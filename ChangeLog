Applications declared DPI-aware in the Windows environmentApplications that run on a Windows computer with desktop scaling enabled
gets scaled incorrectly since windows assumes that applications are
DPI-unaware unless declared otherwise.

This change declares the application DPI-aware, thus not automatically
scaled by the operating system.

The corresponding library call requires Windows 8.1 or later.

Added script to identify Windows versionAdded script to identify the Windows version used to compile the source.
Currently the windows version for Windows NT is hard coded into the
source. By running this CMake script the _WIN32_WINNT preprocessor
variable gets set to the corresponding windows version.


Thu, 30 Nov 2017 12:47:57 +0100
Author : Björn Blissing
Removed unnecessary define in FileUtilsThe define of _WIN32_WINNT was added to handle an error case from MinGW
,as described in commit 712ca432196cd797cc3c265adb2847465551461f

This was later giving warnings and thus undefined for MinGW by commit
3bf6fb1778687c45d389b91675b55f709ef1f67b

Since the two operations cancel each other out, they should be removed.

attached fixes for configuring and building the osgPlugin exr with Visual Studio and using out-of-the-box builds of ilmbase and openexr, i.e. without manual/extra config for using these 2 libs with the OSG.Previously, the assumption was made that ilmbase and openexr were installed in a common directory and hence the header files and libs were both found in that common directory. That is not consistent with other libs and this submission makes it consistent and therefore the OSG configures out of the box. I made this work for ilmbase-2.1.0.tar.gz / openexr-2.1.0.tar.gz and ilmbase-2.2.0.tar.gz / openexr-2.2.0.tar.gz

Attached is a fix in GLExtension, which is based on latest git version, that fixes the usage of uniform buffer objects on macOS. Under macOS core OpenGL features aren't exported as extension. OpenGL 3.1 includes the GL_ARB_uniform_buffer_object as core feature for example. On macOS a simple osg::isGLExtensionSupported() call would fail. It is required to use the isGLExtensionOrVersionSupported() method. This is what my fix does.

Tue, 29 Aug 2017 11:34:27 +0200
Author : Mathieu MARACHE
Under macOS the glValidateProgram reports too many false negatives (errors) about missing buffers, etc..From the internet https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15335510/opengl-glvalidateprogram-error-on-mac-os-x :
« […] The purpose of glValidateProgram is not to use it as an added "check" step after linking the program, because the GL and application state is hardly ready for actually using that program at this point, probably it's even before we get around to initializing the default framebuffer (its bitdepth, its multisample buffers, etc), and that's what the error hints at.

An appropriate place to call glValidateProgram would be right before you make a real render call. »

In the attached GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp file, I changed order of the "else-if" for the TOUCHEVENTF_UP and TOUCHEVENTF_MOVE, I made it less intrusive then changing them into "if" events. I tested this on Windows 7 64-bit with a touch screen and a Windows 10 64-bit tablet.Separately in the same file, I also needed to address the fact that the close button would not react on touch so I added to the top of the "handleNativeWindowingEvent" close button handling in case of touch events. Again this was tested on the same 2 devices.

Avoid call of SetupThreads in DatabasePagerThis solves a bug with some shared library configurations. Sometimes the DatabasePager Singleton is initialised before one can call other configuration options like "setNumOfDatabaseThreadsHint". But OSG initialise it here:

There is a small bug in how the FBX importer computes the rotation matrix for nodes. It applies the "RotationOrder" property to the local, pre, and post rotation values. However, the pre/post rotation values should always use a fixed XYZ order. The "RotationOrder" property should only apply to the local rotation value. I've attached the updated file with the fix.

When the "ZUp" option was added to the fbx loader, it broke the previous behavior of converting to the OpenGL axis system. I'm referencing the following commit:https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/commit/c168887e5e9da4e891904d11ccac8ddd60b0362d

This commit inverted the value of the "fSign" variable, but did not update the previous code that used the variable. I've attached the change that restores the original behavior when not using the "ZUp"

Bug fix to not crash when using shared context and adding / removing windowed views dynamically. The GLExtension object is now reused instead of creating a new when allocating a state on the same ContextID. The static map that stores the GLExtensions is only reset when all references to the extension object are released.

Without this fix, the plugin will only read one PointZ feature even if multiple features exist."

Fri, 5 Aug 2016 13:16:07 +0100
Author : James Turner
Attempt to fix broken DLL exports from osgDBOnly export the osgDB method implementations, instead of the entire
class, and hence avoid exporting symbols from the base class, which
then conflict with other compilation units when linking.

This avoids the need for /FORCE:MULTIPLE linker option with MSVC.

Merge pull request #102 from marchelbling/update_gles+osgjsUpdate gles+osgjs.



This PR

    cleans some gles coverity defects (remaining should only be false positive that need to be sorted out cleanly)
    updates osgjs plugin to support serialization; the history of changes is squashed; details can still be found on cedricpinson fork if needed

As compressed animation channels are no longer part of the main repo, I added a compilation flag for the osgjs plugin. The commit is isolated and the flag is not activated by default.
I am yet to find a better solution to make this plugin entirely free from our specific code.

Note: this PR will not change the gles compilation issues. We only compile on OSX/ubuntu and did not encounter any issue with the plugin.

Adds support for incomplete stl binary filesThe logic is
* if a file is not ascii
* if its sizeis less than the expected binary size
then we can assume that the data is incomplete but still try to load it.

OpenFlight-plugin with extended attributes. Added the addtional properties (terrain, roofline and footprint) alongside with the SMC/FID attributes. Also I added the newly added IRMaterial to the per-geode properties. Added the Texture-EffectId and the mapping index as a user-value to the texture object. Naming scheme is the same as for the per-vertex/geode attributes.

the changes out to CompositeViewer::checkNeedToDoFrame() to ensure that both implementations work the same.

I am hereby submitting a deferred rendering code sample, originally written by Michael Kapelko in 2013. I am submitting this code with his approval.Deferred rendering is now the de-facto standard rendering technique in many modern game engines, hence I think it is important to have this technique demonstrated in an osg code example.

This particular sample adds soft shadows as well as bump mapping into the rendering pipeline. The image files whitemetal_diffuse.jpg and whitemetal_normal.jpg from OpenSceneGraph-Data images folder are required (The OSG_FILE_PATH environment variable must be set correctly)

Two additional osgt models are included with the demo (best to also put them into OpenSceneGraph-Data, I think.

The shaders are currently defined in separate .frag and .vert files.

you do a generic call like osg::createGraphicsContext().

Also implemented is standard proxy object for registering the new contexts and removing them automatically, and

Author : Robert Osfield
From Jannik Heller, "This submission makes the osgFX::Technique traverse as a normal Group if the visitor is not a cull visitor.As for motivation behind the change, I think it makes more sense that way because only the CullVisitor cares about rendering. Say an intersection visitor or update visitor only needs to traverse the subgraph once, not once for each pass. For these visitors there is no point in traversing the subgraph more than once, since it's exactly the same graph. Another motivation is the performance improvement had when an intersection visitor tests against a multipass Technique."

 Note about mods by Robert Osfield, "Changed dyanmic_cast<> and check against getTraversalType() to utilize the new asCullVisitor() instead to improve efficiency."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Jannik Heller, "This submission fixes a stuttering issue that may occur when occlusion query nodes are in view. The problem is that OSG retrieves the occlusion query result without first checking if it's available (GL_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE). Thus, the driver has to sync with the GPU i.e. wait for all queued draw calls to complete. This is particularly bad in V-Synced situations where the driver may be using multi frame queueing techniques - coupled with the fact that OSG only runs an occlusion query every 5th frame, results in very unpleasant stuttering in some situations.The change I made is to check GL_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE before retrieving the query, to ensure that there won't be a stall. If the query result is not available yet, we'll leave it alone and try again in the next frame.

Had to make a few more changes than I'd liked, mostly because the TestResult mechanism wasn't designed for holding on to query objects for more than one frame. As well, I'm thinking that RetrieveQueriesCallback and ClearQueriesCallback could be merged together, if we wanted to go for more refactoring. For though now my strategy is to make as little changes as possible. Let me know what you think of the patch."

From Ognjen Kostic, "Some android phones have no support for OES_element_index_uint extension that is required if glDrawElements is to be called with GL_UNSIGNED_INT for element type. In OSG 3.4, osgText::Text( ::_quadIndices) uses DrawElementsUInt that will fail on these devices and no text will appear - tested on Samsung Galaxy Trend 2 SM-G313HN.When DrawElementsUInt is replaced with DrawElementsUShort it works, although I'm not sure if this can cause other problems with some fonts.

Fix:
- In include\osgText\Text, line 316:
        replace: "osg::ref_ptr< osg::DrawElementsUInt > _quadIndices;"
        with:    "osg::ref_ptr< osg::DrawElementsUShort > _quadIndices;"

- In src\osgText\Text.cpp, line 2094:
        replace: "_quadIndices = new DrawElementsUInt(PrimitiveSet::TRIANGLES);"

Fri, 19 Feb 2016 15:01:27 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Bjorn Blissing, "I stumbled upon a strange ifdef-case inside Geometry.cppCurrently the code looks like this:

Code:
    DrawElementsUByte* elems = new DrawElementsUByte(PrimitiveSet::TRIANGLES);
    elems->push_back(0);
    elems->push_back(1);
    elems->push_back(2);

    elems->push_back(2);
    elems->push_back(3);
    elems->push_back(0);
    geom->addPrimitiveSet(elems);
    geom->addPrimitiveSet(new DrawArrays(PrimitiveSet::QUADS,0,4));

The second condition looked really strange (note the ! sign), and results in pretty much all code paths uses the first code. The correct version should probably be that only people with GLES1 or GLES2 should use GL_TRIANGLES to simulate quads. And all others should use the native support for GL_QUADS.

From "Jannik Heller", I just updated to the latest commit and noticed that drawable cull callbacks were no longer working. As it turns out there was a missing implementation of the asDrawableCullCallback() and asDrawableEventCallback(), after implementing these methods everything is working as expected.

Introduced CMake option OSG_PROVIDE_READFILE option that defaults to ON, but when switched to OFF disables the building of the osgDB::read*File() methods, forcing users to use osgDB::readRef*File() methods.  The later is preferable as it closes a potential threading bug when using paging databases in conjunction with the osgDB::Registry Object Cache.  This threading bug occurs when one thread gets an object from the Cache via an osgDB::read*File() call where only a pointer to the object is passed back, so taking a reference to the object is delayed till it gets reassigned to a ref_ptr<>, but at the same time another thread calls a flush of the Object Cache deleting this object as it's referenceCount is now zero.  Using osgDB::readREf*File() makes sure the a ref_ptr<> is passed back and the referenceCount never goes to zero.To ensure the OSG builds when OSG_PROVIDE_READFILE is to OFF the many cases of osgDB::read*File() usage had to be replaced with a ref_ptr<> osgDB::readRef*File()
usage.  The avoid this change causing lots of other client code to be rewritten to handle the use of ref_ptr<> in place of C pointer I introduced a serious of
templte methods in various class to adapt ref_ptr<> to the underly C pointer to be passed to old OSG API's, example of this is found in include/osg/Group:

    bool addChild(Node* child); // old method which can only be used with a Node*

    tempalte<class T> bool addChild(const osg::ref_ptr<T>& child) { return addChild(child.get()); } // adapter template method

These changes together cover 149 modified files, so it's a large submission. This extent of changes are warrent to make use of the Object Cache
and multi-threaded loaded more robust.

From Curtis Rubel, "I would like to submit the attached file for inclusion in future releases of OpenSceneGraph and the OpenThreads library.The changes in the file simply remove a few ifndef's that currently
do not allow Linux systems to fully utilize the PThread real-time
scheduling API.

Since Linux now fully supports the PThread scheduling API it would
be beneficial to have it available to use as necessary.  I have
been testing this change since OSG release 3.3.7 and have not seen
any ill affects.

The Priority scheduling api is further protected by another ifdef:

#ifdef ALLOW_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING

that only appears to be defined in the pthreads implementation as
well.  This would make it unlikely that anyone would be affected
by this unless they are intentionally wanting to run with priority
scheduling.  In which case on Linux they would need to make
these same modifications themselves to utilize it to its full extent.

Attached file is for the current trunk as of this date.

Refactored the GL object deletion management to use new osg::GraphicsObjectManager/GLObjectManager base classes, and osg::ContextData container.This approach unifies much of the code handling the clean up of OpenGL graphics data, avoids lots of local mutexes and static variables that were previously required,
and enables the clean up scheme to be easily extended by users providing their own GraphicsObjectManager subclasses.

From Jannik Heller, "I've hit what I believe to be a bug (or at the very least, an unintuitive behaviour) in the osg::Geometry copy constructor. I noticed it when using osg::clone on a Geometry with vertex buffer objects, and the copy flags DEEP_COPY_ARRAYS. To be precise, I add a Geometry to an osgUtil::IncrementalCompileOperation, then osg::clone the Geometry. I was getting reports from users of random crashes happening.I believe the offending lines are in the osg::Geometry copy constructor:

    if ((copyop.getCopyFlags() & osg::CopyOp::DEEP_COPY_ARRAYS))
    {
        if (_useVertexBufferObjects)
        {
            // copying of arrays doesn't set up buffer objects so we'll need to force
            // Geometry to assign these, we'll do this by switching off VBO's then renabling them.
            setUseVertexBufferObjects(false);
            setUseVertexBufferObjects(true);
        }
    }

Toggling the vertex buffer objects off then on again actually touches not only the arrays controlled by DEEP_COPY_ARRAYS, but also the PrimitiveSets which are controlled by DEEP_COPY_PRIMITIVES. This means if the user has copyflags of only DEEP_COPY_ARRAYS, we are modifying arrays that belong to the original const Geometry& we are copying from. I believe this shouldn't be allowed to happen because we are using a const& specifier for the original Geometry.

In my case the osgUtil::IncrementalCompileOperation was trying to compile the geometry, while in the main thread a clone operation toggled the VBO's off and on, a crash ensues.

In the attached patch, you will find a more efficient handling of VBO's in the osg::Geometry copy constructor, so that only the Arrays that were actually deep copied have their VBO assigned, and no changes are made to Arrays that already had a valid VBO assigned. In addition, the DEEP_COPY_PRIMITIVES flag is now honored so that VBO's are set up correctly should a user copy a Geometry with only that flag.

From Laurens Voerman, "I found that using an ImageSequence with mode PAGE_AND_DISCARD_USED_IMAGES triggers the (3) imageThreads to run and never stop, even when no more work is to be done. This is due to a bug in the stop condition currently setting the thread to stop and wait for a signal only when no work needs to be done AND the databasepager is paused. It should stop and wait for a signal on either of those two. Due to a few logical inversions it boils down to replacing || with &&OLD _block->set((!_requestList.empty() || !_pager->_databasePagerThreadPaused));
NEW _block->set((!_requestList.empty() && !_pager->_databasePagerThreadPaused));//release the threads to run IF (work_to_be_done && not_paused)

This bug is present since svn rev 8663 (just before 2.6.0 release)

I don't know how to test this path, but it did remove the symbols from libosgViewer.so.  I have also not been able yet to see if that was sufficient for our customer.

 

I did this by looking at other cases, and I tried to follow some of the same practices in PixelBufferX11, like using _useSGIX in a similar way to the previous _useGLX1_3."

From Terry Welsh, "I downloaded the Android 3rdparty deps from here http://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/download-section/dependencies but was not able to use them for a while. Attached are changes to OsgAndroidMacroUtils.cmake that allow the deps to be found by cmake.Specifically, all FIND_PATH commands require the
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH option to actually find paths. This is odd
because if you inspect CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH it appears to be empty. I
would expect it to have no effect at all.

I also needed to remove quotes from this line in order for headers to be found:

set(FREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIRS "${FREETYPE_DIR}/include
${FREETYPE_DIR}/include/freetype/config")

Assuming this script worked in the past, it seems like cmake behavior
may have changed at some point. I'm using cmake version 2.8.12.2."

From Jannik Heller, "Here is a patch for the S3TC capability check.On a Intel HD graphics Linux system with Mesa 10.1.3, I found that osg's Extensions::isTextureCompressionS3TCSupported() returned false, even though S3TC compressed textures *are* in fact working. I tested this by loading and rendering various DXT1, DXT3 and DXT5 compressed textures in the OSG.

"glxinfo | grep s3tc" gives:
    GL_S3_s3tc

Note, if I install the package "libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0", I get in addition:

glxinfo | grep s3tc
    GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc
    GL_S3_s3tc

However, S3TC compressed textures worked correctly within the OSG even without libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0 installed.

I'm not sure what the differences between these extensions are, but based on the description at https://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/S3/s3tc.txt I would assume that both will work for OSG's purposes. The attached patch changes isTextureCompressionS3TCSupported() to accept either extension."

From Cory Slep and Robert Osfield, "When using Open Scene Graph and Qt on Android, the resulting thread that an application developer’s Q*Application is run on is different than what Qt considers the “main” thread, which can cause subtle problems. This is because Qt loads native libraries in one thread, and later runs the application in a different thread. They delay running in the second thread as long as possible as they have a nontrivial bootstrapping process. The motivation for Qt having this second thread is to allow them to remain responsive to both Java and native events, and capture events that would otherwise be “missed”.This gives arise to the requirement that a static initialization of a QObject cannot occur for the Android platform, as Qt incorrectly considers that first thread the “main” one before a client application has even begun executing in its second thread.

 

The HeartBeat in GraphicsWindowQt.cpp is a QObject static global initialized at load time, causing the above issue. This changeset changes it to be a singleton that is constructed upon first access to its “instance” method.

 

I have:

- added the static method “instance”,

- moved its constructor to be private, and

- changed the one place it is accessed to access it through the “instance” method.

"

Changes by Robert are to adopt QPointer<HeartBeat> rather than use a C pointer to ensure that the HeartBeat object will be cleaned up automatically rather than leaked.

This at least provides a proper error message rather than a crash, while we are working on better fixes for the problem."

From Colin McDonald, "An earlier fix in OSG 3.2 has been inadvertently lost in 3.3.x. The glGenerateMipMap function is part of the GL_EXT_framebuffer_object extension. Just checking if the function is present before using it for texture mipmaps is not sufficient, as on remote X-windows displays the client side capability may be different from the display server.  This can lead to mipmapped textures failing to render.  I've restored a fbo extension check.  I've also tided up the GL version checking a little."git-svn-id: http://svn.openscenegraph.org/osg/OpenSceneGraph/trunk@14907 16af8721-9629-0410-8352-f15c8da7e697

From Jannik Heller, "I have added new functions Texture::generateAndAssignTextureObject mirroring the Texture::generateTextureObject functions.I have left the Texture::generateTextureObject functions intact as I'm not sure if/how it's used outside the core OSG. If you feel that compatibility isn't important in that area feel free to drop it.

While testing the build with OSG_USE_REF_PTR_IMPLICIT_OUTPUT_CONVERSION=OFF I found a compile error in GlyphGeometry.cpp that was entirely unrelated to the changes I've made. The fix is included in the patch.

There is one thing left to fix and that is Texture2D::SubloadCallback:

        class OSG_EXPORT SubloadCallback : public Referenced
        {
            public:

From We See, "I found a small bug in osgUtil::RenderStage::draw() (osg 3.3.7), which crashes osg. The problem was caused by an access to the object _camera without checking whether the object is valid. So I changed the line:Code:
if (_cameraRequiresSetUp || (_cameraAttachmentMapModifiedCount!=_camera->getAttachmentMapModifiedCount()))

to

Code:
if (_cameraRequiresSetUp || (_camera.valid() && _cameraAttachmentMapModifiedCount!=_camera->getAttachmentMapModifiedCount()))

From Chris Denham, "I found a couple of memory leaks in 3DS reader plugin and I have attached corrected files. I have attached an example 3DS file I used to test the leaks/fixes using osgviewer for trunk at rev [14853] and the tagged version 3.2.1.The first leak is in the lib3ds module (yeah, I know that probably should be corrected at http://code.google.com/p/lib3ds/ but I'm assuming that as no commits have happened there since 2011 that it may be better to fix the copy we have in the OSG of that project) The leak is caused by lib3d's use of realloc(ptr, 0) to free up memory allocations, but realloc, when ptr==NULL returns malloc(0) rather than NULL and thus leaks a zero byte allocation. The solution here was to adjust the 'lib3ds_util_reserve_array' function so that it realloc is not used to release a NULL pointer.

The second leak is in ReaderWriter3DS.cpp and arises when any of the created StateSet objects added to the StateSetMap don't subsequently get applied to a Node. The solution here was just to simply use the osg::ref_ptr around the raw StateSet pointer that was used in the locally defined StateSetInfo struct."

From Jannik Heller, "Fix for Qt4 multi-threaded crash. This patch adds the AA_X11InitThreads flag to the QApplication setup, meaning QT will call XInitThreads for us. This also bumps the required QT version to 4.8+, because the AA_X11InitThreads flag was introduced in that version. If that is not acceptable, we could add a QT_VERSION >= 0x040800 guard, or manually call XInitThreads() instead. Let me know what you think."git-svn-id: http://svn.openscenegraph.org/osg/OpenSceneGraph/trunk@14804 16af8721-9629-0410-8352-f15c8da7e697

From Miha Ravselj, "Regarding previous submission it was only partial solution. After further testing I found similar bug also in ClearNode serializer.//GLbitfield mask = GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT|GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT;
This line was problematic since it produced incorrect result when let's say COLOR flag is serialized
it should be null as in Camera serializer or in a proposed BitFlagsSerializer


This line of code caused that whenever only GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT bit was written and on value read GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT|GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT was restored instead of GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT only.

//GLbitfield mask = 0; //this resolves the issue same as in camera
Also same bit-wise comparison bug was also present in write method.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see there are total 3 bit mask serializers in OSG and all 3 had bugs so I decided to add ADD_BITFLAGS_SERIALIZER and replace USER serializers in osg::Camera, osg::ClearNode and osgText::TextBase. I have made sure that bitflags serializer does not break backwards-compatibility since it uses same code as user serializer does in all 3 cases. (see tester.cpp on how compatibility test was performed)"

From Michael McDonnel, "The tessellation shader example has a small bug.The middle of the geometry is clipped as soon as it is tessellated. The clipping is probably caused by rounding errors because it is only in one spot. The clipping disappears when the camera is moved, and reappears when it is moved back. Expanding the the bounding box fixed the clipping bug."Tweaked by Robert Osfield to expand it to a -1 to 1 unit box.
Actual clipping bug is not due to rounding errors but the shaders creating vertices outside the bounding box of the original input vertices

From Jannik Heller, "I noticed the rotation in the OrbitManipulator depends on the framerate. To reproduce this issue, start the osganimate example, rotate the model with the left mouse button, then let go of the mouse button while still moving. You will notice that with V-Sync enabled, the model rotates slower.The OrbitManipulator calculates a scale to counteract the framerate dependency, but it turns out this scale wasn't used for the rotation yet."

From Jamie Robertson, "I've been using osgSim::ScalarBar to display fixed range color values (e.g. red from 1-2, green from 3-4 etc), by setting the _numColors the same as the number of actual colors in the ColorRange.Currently if you do this you get strange looking results as the colors are calculated for values in the centre of each color step, so if your steps are large, the colors are interpolated sigificantly (see screen grab of red, green and blue colors for illustration).

I've attached a fix which just uses the original color values whenever _numColors equals the number of actual defined colors in the ColorRange. I doubt anyone would want interpolated colors in these circumstances."

From Dmitry Marakasov, "While packaging osg-3.3.3 I've discovered that gstreamer detection is broken:-- Could NOT find GStreamer (missing:  GSTREAMER_BASE_INCLUDE_DIRS GSTREAMER_BASE_LIBRARIES GSTREAMER_GSTREAMER-APP_INCLUDE_DIRS GSTREAMER_GSTREAMER-APP_LIBRARIES GSTREAMER_GSTREAMER-PBUTILS_INCLUDE_DIRS GSTREAMER_GSTREAMER-PBUTILS_LIBRARIES) (found version "1.4.5")

though all required modules are installed.

There are two problems: first, module names are spelled incorrectly in root
CMakeLists.txt (e.g. gstreamer-app instead of app), so variables expected
for them are e.g. GSTREAMER_GSTREAMER-APP_INCLUDE_DIRS instead of
GSTREAMER_APP_INCLUDE_DIRS.

Second, gstreamer base component is detected as GSTREAMER while checked
later as GSTREAMER_BASE. I've uncommented the detection as
GSTREAMER_BASE, but obviously that should be revisited and only one
detection left. With this patch, gstreamer is detected properly and
the plugins is successfully built and installed."

From Jonathan Greig, "I was testing out the example and it works fine as a standalone example, but I found that it didn't work as expected when adding the class to some existing code I have to test it out. The osg widget was appearing but it didn't appear to be updating. After tweaking it to pass on the parent QWidget pointer from my code, it worked as expected. I added the WindowFlags to the attached file for good measure. If you look at the Qt Documentation for QWidget ( http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#QWidget ), you'll see that is exactly where I got this from. When subclassing a widget as such, you should allow the user to pass in the parent at least, considering that has a major effect on how or if Qt may clean up the memory."git-svn-id: http://svn.openscenegraph.org/osg/OpenSceneGraph/trunk@14718 16af8721-9629-0410-8352-f15c8da7e697

From Javier Taibo, "I have found a "bug" in the new audio decoding code (actually I think the bug is in ffmpeg, but anyway it should be wise to protect the OSG plug-in about it). I am attaching a security check in FFmpegDecoderAudio.cpp.If anybody is curious about the problem, it happens sometimes when decoding an AAC audio stream. It eventually includes a PCE block inside the AAC audio frame and then ffmpeg audio decoding function signals a "new_frame" with 1024 samples, but a null pointer instead of the audio data. It can be easily detected because in these cases number of channels is 0. Maybe this is the intended behaviour for ffmpeg, but I find it quite weird.
"

" It seems that libav does not have a channels attribute in AVFrame structure. This new version should do."

From Javier Taibo, "I have found that since version 1.1, FFMPEG changed the way audio streams are retrieved, from packed to planar format. SDL interprets packed audio, as is used in the osgmovie example. To make the audio work when the OSGffmpeg plug-in is compiled against recent FFMPEG versions, FFmpegDecoderAudio must check for planar formats and in these cases request the samples as packed. This way all works as before. It can be checked with osgmovie example application.  $ osgmovie --audio movie.avi.ffmpeg
  FFmpegImageStream::open audio failed, audio stream will be disabled: unknown audio format

  With the attached FFmpegDecoderAudio.cpp, audio sounds correctly.

  I am also attaching a modified version of FindFFmpeg.cmake that allows to set as FFMPEG_DIR the ffmpeg compiled in the source directory structure. It should not break anything as it only adds some additional search paths.

From Aurélien Chatelain, "the smoothing visitor did not handle shared arrays. It may leads to bad geometry arrays when a shared array is involved in the scene. This submission adds shared array duplication (and moves the SharedArrayOptimizer declaration in MeshOptimizer to make it callable from the SmoothingVisitor)."Submitted by Marc Helbling.
Edited by Robet Osfield to retain the usual OSG coding style.

From Javier Taibo, " I have found that since version 1.1, FFMPEG changed the way audio streams are retrieved, from packed to planar format. SDL interprets packed audio, as is used in the osgmovie example. To make the audio work when the OSGffmpeg plug-in is compiled against recent FFMPEG versions, FFmpegDecoderAudio must check for planar formats and in these cases request the samples as packed. This way all works as before. It can be checked with osgmovie example application.  $ osgmovie --audio movie.avi.ffmpeg
  FFmpegImageStream::open audio failed, audio stream will be disabled: unknown audio format

  With the attached FFmpegDecoderAudio.cpp, audio sounds correctly.

  I am also attaching a modified version of FindFFmpeg.cmake that allows to set as FFMPEG_DIR the ffmpeg compiled in the source directory structure. It should not break anything as it only adds some additional search paths.

"

Note from Robert Osfield, I have found in testing that audio quality is not good for planar floating point formats, even with adding support for SDL2 to the osgmovie example. I haven't yet tracked down the cause of these audio problems or a solution.

From Marc Helbling, "please find enclosed a submission that should improve the VertexAccessOrderVisitor (pre-transform) optimizer: * it sorts primitives to keep "more complex" primitives first; maybe you'll prefer to have this as an option (but usually it should make more sense to pre-transform triangles before e.g. lines) * currently, the visitor rely on TriangleIndexFunctor and does not take care of points and lines (see https://github.com/openscenegraph/osg/blob/master/include/osg/TriangleIndexFunctor#L124-130). This can lead to issues e.g. if you store the wireframe lines along with some triangles: the triangles will be reindexed but not the line. I've therefore added osg/include/TriangleLinePointIndexFunctor to index triangles, lines and points and derived VertexReorder from this class. * to avoid issues, shared arrays are duplicated. However, in some cases (e.g. an UV channel shared in the geometry only) this is not required. I'm adding a SharedArrayOptimizer to optimize this: it looks for duplicated UVs before the array duplication and deduplicate arrays after.

From Marc Helbling, "please find the mergeTriangleStrip code merged in osgUtil::TriStripVisitor. I've removed the references to DrawArrays as we should no longer produce any.Note that:
* as the name suggest, it only works for triangle strips but could probably be easily extended to quads
* the resulting primitive is not highly optimized; we could probably sort the strips in order to minimize the number of primitive restart
* as we may merge DrawElementsUInt and DrawElementUShort, the code will only generate DrawElementsUInt"

From PawelKsiezopolski, "This submission contains a new example for OSG : a geometry instancing rendering algorithm consisting of two consequent phases :- first phase is a GLSL shader performing object culling and LOD picking ( a culling shader ).
  Every culled object is represented as GL_POINT in the input osg::Geometry.
  The output of the culling shader is a set of object LODs that need to be rendered.
  The output is stored in texture buffer objects. No pixel is drawn to the screen
  because GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD mode is used.

- second phase draws osg::Geometry containing merged LODs using glDrawArraysIndirect()
  function. Information about quantity of instances to render, its positions and other
  parameters is sourced from texture buffer objects filled in the first phase.

The example uses various OpenGL 4.2 features such as texture buffer objects,
atomic counters, image units and functions defined in GL_ARB_shader_image_load_store
extension to achieve its goal and thus will not work on graphic cards with older OpenGL
versions.

The example was tested on Linux and Windows with NVidia 570 and 580 cards.
The tests on AMD cards were not conducted ( due to lack of it ).
The tests were performed using OSG revision 14088.

The main advantages of this rendering method :
- instanced rendering capable of drawing thousands of different objects with
  almost no CPU intervention  ( cull and draw times are close to 0 ms ).
- input objects may be sourced from any OSG graph ( for example - information about
  object points may be stored in a PagedLOD graph. This way we may cover the whole
  countries with trees, buildings and other objects ).
  Furthermore if we create osgDB plugins that generate data on the fly, we may
  generate information for every grass blade for that country.
- every object may have its own parameters and thus may be distinct from other objects
  of the same type.
- relatively low memory footprint ( single object information is stored in a few
  vertex attributes ).
- no GPU->CPU roundtrip typical for such methods ( method uses atomic counters
  and glDrawArraysIndirect() function instead of OpenGL queries. This way
  information about quantity of rendered objects never goes back to CPU.
  The typical GPU->CPU roundtrip cost is about 2 ms ).
- this example also shows how to render dynamic objects ( objects that may change
  its position ) with moving parts ( like car wheels or airplane propellers ) .
  The obvious extension to that dynamic method would be the animated crowd rendering.
- rendered objects may be easily replaced ( there is no need to process the whole
  OSG graphs, because these graphs store only positional information ).

The main disadvantages of a method :
- the maximum quantity of objects to render must be known beforehand
  ( because texture buffer objects holding data between phases have constant size ).
- OSG statistics are flawed ( they don't know anymore how many objects are drawn ).
- osgUtil::Intersection does not work

Example application may be used to make some performance tests, so below you
will find some extended parameter description :
--skip-dynamic       - skip rendering of dynamic objects if you only want to
                       observe static object statistics
--skip-static        - the same for static objects
--dynamic-area-size  - size of the area for dynamic rendering. Default = 1000 meters
                       ( square 1000m x 1000m ). Along with density defines
                       how many dynamic objects is there in the example.
--static-area-size   - the same for static objects. Default = 2000 meters
                       ( square 2000m x 2000m ).

Example application defines some parameters (density, LOD ranges, object's triangle count).
You may manipulate its values using below described modifiers:
--density-modifier   - density modifier in percent. Default = 100%.
                       Density ( along with LOD ranges ) defines maximum
                       quantity of rendered objects. registerType() function
                       accepts maximum density ( in objects per square kilometer )
                       as its parameter.
--lod-modifier       - defines the LOD ranges. Default = 100%.
--triangle-modifier  - defines the number of triangles in finally rendered objects.
                       Default = 100 %.
--instances-per-cell - for static rendering the application builds OSG graph using
                       InstanceCell class ( this class is a modified version of Cell class
                       from osgforest example - it builds simple quadtree from a list
                       of static instances ). This parameter defines maximum number
                       of instances in a single osg::Group in quadtree.
                       If, for example, you modify it to value=100, you will see
                       really big cull time in OSG statistics ( because resulting
                       tree generated by InstanceCell will be very deep ).
                       Default value = 4096 .
--export-objects     - write object geometries and quadtree of instances to osgt files
                       for later analysis.
--use-multi-draw     - use glMultiDrawArraysIndirect() instead of glDrawArraysIndirect() in a
                       draw shader. Thanks to this we may render all ( different ) objects
                       using only one draw call. Requires OpenGL version 4.3 and some more
                       work from me, because now it does not work ( probably I implemented
                       it wrong, or Windows NVidia driver has errors, because it hangs
                       the apllication at the moment ).

This application is inspired by Daniel Rákos work : "GPU based dynamic geometry LOD" that
may be found under this address : http://rastergrid.com/blog/2010/10/gpu-based-dynamic-geometry-lod/
There are however some differences :
- Daniel Rákos uses GL queries to count objects to render, while this example
  uses atomic counters ( no GPU->CPU roundtrip )
- this example does not use transform feedback buffers to store intermediate data
  ( it uses texture buffer objects instead ).
- I use only the vertex shader to cull objects, whereas Daniel Rákos uses vertex shader
  and geometry shader ( because only geometry shader can send more than one primitive
  to transform feedback buffers ).
- objects in the example are drawn using glDrawArraysIndirect() function,
  instead of glDrawElementsInstanced().

Finally there are some things to consider/discuss  :
- the whole algorithm exploits nice OpenGL feature that any GL buffer
  may be bound as any type of buffer ( in our example a buffer is once bound
  as a texture buffer object, and later is bound as GL_DRAW_INDIRECT_BUFFER ).
  osg::TextureBuffer class has one handy method to do that trick ( bindBufferAs() ),
  and new primitive sets use osg::TextureBuffer as input.
  For now I added new primitive sets to example ( DrawArraysIndirect and
  MultiDrawArraysIndirect defined in examples/osggpucull/DrawIndirectPrimitiveSet.h ),
  but if Robert will accept its current implementations ( I mean - primitive
  sets that have osg::TextureBuffer in constructor ), I may add it to
  osg/include/PrimitiveSet header.
- I used BufferTemplate class writen and published by Aurelien in submission forum
  some time ago. For some reason this class never got into osg/include, but is
  really needed during creation of UBOs, TBOs, and possibly SSBOs in the future.
  I added std::vector specialization to that template class.
- I needed to create similar osg::Geometries with variable number of vertices
  ( to create different LODs in my example ). For this reason I've written
  some code allowing me to create osg::Geometries from osg::Shape descendants.
  This code may be found in ShapeToGeometry.* files. Examples of use are in
  osggpucull.cpp . The question is : should this code stay in example, or should
  it be moved to osgUtil ?
- this remark is important for NVidia cards on Linux and Windows : if
  you have "Sync to VBlank" turned ON in nvidia-settings and you want to see
  real GPU times in OSG statistics window, you must set the power management
  settings to "Prefer maximum performance", because when "Adaptive mode" is used,
  the graphic card's clock may be slowed down by the driver during program execution
  ( On Linux when OpenGL application starts in adaptive mode, clock should work
  as fast as possible, but after one minute of program execution, the clock slows down ).
  This happens when GPU time in OSG statistics window is shorter than 3 ms.

From Jan Klimke, "i noticed, that there are a couple of additional flaws when building osg for Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite.The mac os sdk version is recognized by the current CMAKE script as 10.1 instead of 10.10 since it cuts the version string from the 4th place. I introduced a more reliable version checking based on splitting the returned version code into MAJOR MINOR and PATCH parts and reassemble the OSG sdk version afterwards.

I replaced the existing CMake code against the following (returning now version 10.10 as expected):

 # Determine the canonical name of the selected Platform SDK
   EXECUTE_PROCESS(COMMAND "/usr/bin/sw_vers" "-productVersion"
                   OUTPUT_VARIABLE OSG_OSX_SDK_NAME
                   OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)
   STRING(REPLACE "." ";" MACOS_VERSION_LIST ${OSG_OSX_SDK_NAME})
   LIST(GET MACOS_VERSION_LIST 0 MACOS_VERSION_MAJOR)
   LIST(GET MACOS_VERSION_LIST 1 MACOS_VERSION_MINOR)
   LIST(GET MACOS_VERSION_LIST 2 MACOS_VERSION_PATCH)

   SET(OSG_OSX_SDK_NAME "macosx${MACOS_VERSION_MAJOR}.${MACOS_VERSION_MINOR}")

Also i added the check for the new Version to some more find scripts.

Additionally the nil object in Objective C now seems to be equivalent with a null_ptr that cannot be passed as GLInt anymore. So i switched this in the PixelBufferCocoa.mm to pass a zero instead of nil.

From Alberto Luaces,"the current code uses the preprocessor for generating the plugin path in a way that when CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX contains something along the lines of/usr/x86_64-linux-gnu/

it gets substituted as

/usr/x86_64-1-gnu/

that is, the string is preprocessed again, thereby making changes to
anything that matches any defined symbol, as "linux" in this example
(https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=763816).

Quoting that path directly in CMake scripts solves that problem.

From Rafa Gaitan, "I finally had some time to change the build system for Android using a Toolchain, which, I think, will be easier to maintain and uses cmake standard system to build it.My changes:
-------------------
- I changed the cmake files and added a toolchain for building OSG in Android. The toolchain is based on the one used at OpenCV. For building OSG for android you just need to do:

    mkdir build_android_static_gles2 && cd build_android_static_gles2
    cmake .. -DANDROID_NDK=<path-to-the-android-ndk>
                  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../PlatformSpecifics/Android/android.toolchain.cmake
                  -DOPENGL_PROFILE="GLES2"
                  -DDYNAMIC_OPENTHREADS=OFF
                  -DDYNAMIC_OPENSCENEGRAPH=OFF
                  -DANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL=15 # optional
                  -DANDROID_ABI=armeabim #optional
                  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path-to-the-install-path> #optional
make -j 8
make install

    The OPENGL_PROFILE works as expected, changing it to "GLES1" it builds and links OSG using GLES1.
    The DYNAMIC_OPENTHREADS/DYNAMIC_OPENSCENEGRAPH parameters also allows to build the dynamic libraries

- I also added some build fixes for android related to the texture formats and added some missing USE_OSG_SERIALIZER_WRAPPER in the osg serializer library to support loading osgb files in static."

From Pjotr Svetachov, "I was experimenting with VBO's to try to get them on par with display lists when drawing lots of batches and noticed that my program generated a lot of unneeded glClientActiveTexture calls. Digging deeper I found out it came from State::disableTexCoordPointer where the function would call glClientActiveTexture but not glDisableClientState because the geometry didn't have texture coordinates for that channel. This is because in our scene there are some geometries that have move than one uv channels making State::_texCoordArrayList grow. Then the method State::applyDisablingOfVertexAttributes() will call disableTexCoordPointer multiple times.I rearrange the method a little to combat this. Now the logic has the
same ordering as disableTexCoordPointersAboveAndIncluding which
already combats this."

From Pjotr Svetachov, "I tried your fix and it exposed a bug in my fix :) The problem is that the readObjectFields method will add the object to the _identifierMap. So all the other instances of that image in the same file will be replaced by the created dummy object. In my fix this was an dummy image and I didn't notice it in our scene's, probably because it covered a small part of an object. In your fix the dummy object was not an image and that leads to a crash when something tries to use it as an image. I have attached a small fix for this bug."

From Ryan Kawicki, "There is an issue where the model insets of a terrex terrain are being removed during the loading process.  The issue is described below.    - the issue here is that the plugin is removing group nodes if
      that group node only has one child.  becuase transforms are also
      group nodes, there were cases when the transform would have only
      one child under it and would cause it to remove the translation
      portion.  this would cause all the vertex data to be loaded around
      the last matrix operation, which in our case was the origin (0,0,0).

We work off of OSG 2.8.1 but see that this has not been addressed on latest yet.  I’ve tested this against 2.8.1 and have cleanly applied it to my local repository off of latest."

From Tim George, "Currently there is a problem with using a camera with a viewport with a non 0 offset and also using an FBO. The problem is that only area made up of the viewports width and height is drawn based on an offset of 0,0 instead of using the viewports offset.It is caused by line 991 in RenderStage.cpp:


Code:
fbo_ext->glBlitFramebuffer(
0, 0, static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->width()), static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->height()),
0, 0, static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->width()), static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->height()),
blitMask, GL_NEAREST);



which is not taking into account the viewport x and y when performing the blit. It probably should be:


Code:
fbo_ext->glBlitFramebuffer(
static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->x()), static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->y()),
static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->width()) + static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->x()), static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->height()) + static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->y()),
static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->x()), static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->y()),
static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->width()) + static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->x()), static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->height()) + static_cast<GLint>(_viewport->y()),
blitMask, GL_NEAREST);
"

Note from Robert Osfield, made small tweak to above on merge, changing the width+x to x+width to make it read more naturally.

From Marc Helbling, "please find a fix for the vertex pretransform visitor (VertexAccessOrderVisitor). The issue with current code is that arrays are collected *before* duplicating shared arrays which leads to arrays that are correctly duplicated but that are not reordered.Also the submitted patch contains a small cleaning in GeometryArrayGathrer as the _useDrawElements variable is not used; it is only set in the GeometryArrayGathrer constructor and VertexAccessOrderVisitor already checks that primitives have indexed type."

From Lauren Voerman, "In order to speed up loading large scenes (especially from network disk) I added code to our viewer to setup multiple database-pagers and request the files trough a database-request: databasePager->setUpThreads(16, 1);We experienced problems with multiple databasepagers loading files in parallel, when two threads start to load the same file (usually a texture referenced by multiple models). The second thread to add the file to the cache (sometimes) manages to do so while the refcount from the cached object still is zero, causing the object loaded to be destroyed.
Sometimes the second thread manages to ref() the object before Referenced::signalObserversAndDelete does the final recount check, causing a warning:
    "Warning Referenced::signalObserversAndDelete(,,) doing delete with _refCount=1"

With a deleted object added to the scenegraph we get some undesired results, I think the program only crashes if the object was a Node, and just has some untextured surfaces if it was a texture, but I'm not completely sure.

Attached is a modified version of the Registry.cpp, returning the object in cache and let the duplicate loaded object to be destroyed.

A more efficient option would be to add some sort of blocking entry to the objectcache to stop the second thread from reading the file, and just wait until the first thread added it to the cache. If you think that's worthwile we would be happy to implement that version. A bit tricky to implement and test, that's why I submit a simple version that stops my program from crashing."

In this case all corners of the bounding box need to be transformed in order to get the correct containing box. I've attached the updated file."

From Alexander Sinditskiy, "My changes added support for gltexstorrage2d for texture2d.Initially I described issue in message:
http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=13820
It solves issue with compiling texture using ico from image with mipmaps

I added enviroment variable OSG_GL_TEXTURE_STORAGE_ENABLE to control usage of glTexStorage2d. Initially it is disabled.

It used only if image have mipmaps.

Another issue is converting from internalFormat + type to sized internal format. I created sizedInternalFormats[] struct where sized internal formats are ordered from worse->best.
also this struct have commented lines. Commented formats are listed in
http://www.opengl.org/wiki/GLAPI/glTexStorage2D
but looks like not using in osg."

Note from Robert Osfield.  Changed the env var control to OSG_GL_TEXTURE_STORAGE and made it's value true by default when the feature is supported by the OpenGL driver.  To disable to
use of glTexStorage2D use OSG_GL_TEXTURE_STORAGE="OFF" or "DISABLE"

- Added traverse(NodeVisitor) to Geode which calls accept(NodeVisitor) on all Drawables

- Updated CullVisitor to use new apply(Drawable) to handle drawables. The apply(Billboard) method still manually handles the drawables since it is depends on the billboard settings. I needed to disable the traverse within billboard to prevent duplicate traversal of drawables.

From Ali Botorabi, "recently I ran into a problem with Microsoft's Appverifier while using OpenThreads on win32 platform. The Appverifier complained about an invalid thread handle during starting of a new thread. After looking closer into the problem it seemed that indeed a potential root of problem may be in the thread startup code. See the line below in Win32Thread.cpp (line number 347):    pd->tid.set( (void*)_beginthreadex(NULL,static_cast<unsigned>(pd->stackSize),ThreadPrivateActions::StartThread,static_cast<void *>(this),0,&ID));

the method "pd->tid.set" sets the thread id, however via the startup function "ThreadPrivateActions::StartThread" that thread id is used (see further down the call hierarchy the line "int status = SetThreadPriority( pd->tid.get(), prio);".

Until now I never ran into any problem in debug or release builds, though. It seems that furtunately the tid.set method was executed always before the tid.get method in the startup code. However, this may make trouble in the furture. A simple solution is the following: just replace the line above with following two lines:

    pd->tid.set( (void*)_beginthreadex(NULL,static_cast<unsigned>(pd->stackSize),ThreadPrivateActions::StartThread,static_cast<void *>(this),CREATE_SUSPENDED,&ID));
    ResumeThread(pd->tid.get());


The trick is just starting the thread in suspended mode so the StartThread function does not get executed and we can safely store the tid by pd->tid.set. Then start the Thread by calling ResumeThread."

From Pjotr Svetachov, "have added some missing serializers for RigGeomery. Withouth them I ran into two issues.At first you get a bunch of warnings that osg::ComputeBoundCallback
and osg::UpdateCallback were unsupported wrapper classes when
converting fbx models with skeletal animation to osg(t/b).

The second issue was that when reading, the readers fail to read the
ComputeBoundCallback and UpdateCallback and set them to NULL which
messes up the RigGeometry.

Because a RigGeometry makes his own classes in the constructor it
might be preferable to not write them at all, because now those
classes are being made two times when reading a RigGeometry. But after
thinking about this that would place too much limits on them (you
won't be able to share or name them and save that information or make
a new inherited class from them and write that one) So I ended up
thinking the best way was to just write the files.

From Pjotr Svetachov, "Today I found a bug in the IutputStream class when saving array attributes in vec3b format. It looks like my compiler takes the wrong overload and outputs integers instead of characters. The problem is that vec3b is of type signed char and that is not the same as char ( see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/436513/char-signed-char-char-unsigned-char ) and visual studio 2013 will promote it to integer when choosing an overload. It looks like that the InputStream class already takes care of this issue (if it didn't it would have read everything ok and I would have not even stumbled upon this bug. :) )"

From Jason Beverage, "Here is a fix for a small race condition in osgDB::makeDirectory.  It attempts to create all the directories in the given path and stops attempting to make directories when one of them fails.  I've added a check to see if the failure occurred b/c the directory was created by another thread or process.We were running into issues occasionally in osgEarth where multiple threads were writing out files like /1/2/3.jpg and /1/3/4.jpg.  Both threads would try to create the /1 directory and only one of them would succeed.  So the first thread would write out the full /1/2/3.jpg while the second thread wouldn't create the /1/3 directory b/c /1 was already created and the writing of /1/3/4.jpg would fail.

From Kristofer Tingdahl, "I and my team have gone over the code again, and we feel that we are comfortable in our current proposal for change. It goes deeper than it did before, and I explain why:There was code in the osgViewer/Viewer.cpp and osgViewer/CompositeViewer.cpp that transformed the Y-coordinates of an event. The code in the composite viewer did however miss the touch-data of the event. I thought that it should really be the GUIEventAdapter that should know about this, and hence I added the
GUIEventAdapter::setMouseYOrientationAndUpdateCoords which is re-computing the coordinates. First I simply added a boolean to the setMouseYOrientation function:

setMouseYOrientation( MouseYOrientation, bool updatecooreds=false );

but then the serializer complained.

This function is called from both the Viewer and the CompositeViewer. We have not tested from the viewer, but I cannot see it would not work from visual inspection.

The other change is in MultiTouchTrackballManipulator::handleMultiTouchDrag. I have removed the normalisation. The reason for that is that it normalised into screen coordinates from 0,0 to 1,1. The problem with that is that if you have a pinch event and you keep the distance say 300 pixels between your fingers, these 300 pixels represent 0.20 of the screen in the horizontal domain, but 0.3 of the screen in the vertical domain. A rotation of the pinch-fingers will hence result in a zoom in, as the normalised distance is changing between them.

A consequence of this is that I have changed the pan-code to use the same algorithm as the middle-mouse-pan.

The rest of it is very similar from previous revision, and there has been some fine-tuning here and there.

From Mattias Helsing, "Seems I was only half right given what you asked for. CMP0017 only says that modules that are found and ran from cmake modules dir should prefer cmake-provided modules. find_package() and include() still look in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH first.After some investigating I've come up with a proposal examplified in
the attached FindGDAL.cmake script. It simply calls the cmake provided
FindGDAL.cmake if it exists and returns if it succeeds in finding GDAL
using that, otherwise continue with our local cmake code.
Pro: Wont clutter our root CMakeLists.txt
Con: If we begin to write more advanced Findxxx modules (using
COMPONENTS, REQUIRED etc.) we may have to revise this scheme.

Introduced new scheme for setting up which version of OpenGL/OpenGL ES the OSG is compiled for.To select standard OpenGL 1/2 build with full backwards and forwards comtability use:

  ./configure
  make

OR

  ./configure -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GL2

To select OpenGL 3 core profile build using GL3/gl3.h header:

  ./configure -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GL3

To select OpenGL Arb core profile build using GL/glcorearb.h header:

  ./configure -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GLCORE

To select OpenGL ES 1.1 profile use:

  ./configure -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GLES1

To select OpenGL ES 2 profile use:

  ./configure -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GLES2


Using OPENGL_PROFILE will select all the appropriate features required so no other settings in cmake will need to be adjusted.
The new configuration options are stored in the include/osg/OpenGL header that deprecates the old include/osg/GL header.

From Paul Cheyrou-Lagreze, "Attached is fix/feature for FBX osgplugins against latest trunk:- ReaderWriterFBX.cpp: add "z up scene axis" support:  FBX provides facility to convert model scene axis during conversion. Currently fbx plugin convert axis to fbx:opengl axis system (which is arbitrarily at Y up, as opengl is in reality axis agnostic) and sometimes what is needed is Z up so added an option for Z up conversion

From Sebastian Messerschmidt, "n the trunk version the osgGA::GUIActionAdapter has additional functions for lineIntersection which use osgGA::GUIEventAdapter&, but the class declaration is neither forwarded, nor is the header included. Using the trunk together with osgEarth 2.5 will fail to build, due to the missing type.Attached is the file forward declaring osgGA::GUIEventAdapter."

From Jan Peciva, "I am sending four fixes to obj plugin:- materialName used to be not stripped of whitespace, making number of models
fail to load materials; now fixed
- stripping was considering spaces only, thus models using tabs had problems
to load correctly; fixed
- fixed references to textures; they did not performed conversion to native
directory separators
- make d (dissolve) takes precedence over Tr (transparency); there seems to be
a confusion about the Tr item - some claiming 1 to be opaque and 0
transparent, while number of models uses exactly the opposite. d (dissolve),
if present in the model, does not suffer from this confusion, thus using it
instead fixes the problem for many many models.

I put many comments to the file concerning d and Tr item as others may further
investigate. Let me know in the case of any problems."

From Marcel Pursche, "The problem is that when OpenThreads is build with the Linux pthreads implementation all threads inherit the processor affinity from their parent thread. This behavior is also described in the pthreads man page (http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_create.3.html):>
> Linux-specific details
> The new thread inherits copies of the calling thread's capability
> sets (see capabilities(7)) and CPU affinity mask (see
> sched_setaffinity(2)).
>

To prevent this behaviour I wrote a patch that explicitly sets the affinity mask to all cores of the system, if no specific affinity was defined with PThread::setProcessorAffinity(unsigned int) .

Thank you!

From Bjorn Blessing, "I got bored of the constant reports of “missing chunk 0xA08A” when reading 3ds-files. After a bit of research I discovered that this property is related to the advanced transparency settings for the material in 3D studio. In this case the falloff parameter. These controls affect the opacity falloff of a transparent material. And the property chooses whether falloff is in or out. I have added the property to the file reader BUT no changes are made to make this property propagate into the osgMaterial. But at least we get rid of this annoying error message."

From Paul Martz, "We discussed the issue of GL_RED_SNORM and GL_RG_SNORM some time ago, but the issue was never completely resolved. Please see the attached submission to fix the issue.osg/GL2Extensions was incorrectly defining GL_RED_SNORM and GL_RG_SNORM as part of the definitions for OpenGL v3.1. However, a quick review of the 3.1 spec indicates that these are not part of the 3.1 standard.

My attached change moves these definitions out of the #ifndef GL_VERSION_3_1 conditional block, and defines them conditionally if not already defined. This allows the DDS plugin to build for GL3.

From Stephan Huber, "attached is a fix for the rest-http-plugin which should fix the font-issue reported by Phil. The old implementation did forward all requests to the internal http-server via user-events. This prevented error-reporting for missing files, as the request was accidentally handled by the plugin. As a request for missing font-file succeeds and returned an empty file, the curl-plugin hands the data happily to the freetype-plugin which failed trying to load an empty font-file, obviously.My fix was to rename the standard request handler to a specialized user-event-handler which handles only requests for "/user-event“

So fonts should work on iOS when loaded remotely, even when a local file is available and with the resthttp-plugin serving the presentation.

Added osg::CallbackObject to be used to extend C++ class from scripting languages by providing callback objects assigned to the osg::Object UserDataContainer, with the CallbackObject's Name used to map the "method" provided by the CallbackObject.  The CallbackObject is implemented by the script engine to provide the neccessary glue to invoking the script with the appropriate input parameters and handling the output parameters.To the Lua plugin added support for assigned lua functions to C++ osg::Objects via the new osg::CallbackObject mechanism.  To invoke the scripts function from C++ one must get the CallbackObject and call run on it.

Renamed ScriptCallback to ScriptNodeCallback to avoid possibly confusion between osg::CallbackObject and the ScriptNodeCallback.

From Aurelien Albert, "In the "apply" method of osg::FrameBufferObject, the draw buffers are always enabled, even if the target is only "READ_FRAMEBUFFER".This can lead to inconsistency if you bind a framebuffer with multiple attachments in DRAW mode and then a framebuffer with different attachment count in READ mode (for example to manually "blit" from a FBo to another).

On some ATI cards (at least RADEON HD) this also leads to an "incomplete " FBO status

I've added a test to enable drawbuffers only if target is "DRAW" or "READ_DRAW", this solves my problems on ATI cards."

From Kristofer Tingdahl,"we have a bunch of classes that inherit osg::Node, and they create their own, internal geometry which is passed into the render bucket at the cull-traversal. Last week, we realised that these classes are not accounted for when doing an ComputeBoundVisitor- traversal, as there is no specialization in ComputeBoundVisitor for them.One solution is naturally to create a new class that would inherit the osg::ComputeBoundVisitor, and use that. I don't like that idea as the ComputeBoundVisitor does actually have what I need - it is only hidden in a protected function.

I am therefor suggesting a slight generalization of the ComputeBoundVisitor with the attached patch, which is tested.

The patch has two parts:
we add applyBBox() so that one can use that in a customized traverse-function and add a bbox to the visitor. I considered calling this function expandByBBox(), but I though  applyBBox was better.
The MatrixStack is made available to the outside world. That enables a traverse-function to do whatever it wishes.
I do actually only need one of the two, as I can implement what I wish either way, but adding getMatrixStack() will make more generic expansions possible.
"

From Robert Osfield, changed the name of the new applyBBox(..) method to applyBoundingBox(..) to keep it's naming more consistent with the rest of the OSG.

From Stephan Huber, "attached are some fixes to the osc-plugin and the touch-implementations for iOS and os x and other small bugfixes. These fixes will normalize the orientation of the touch points, and transmitting the touch points over osc via the TUIO-protocol works now more robustly between two osg-applications.I added a new tag to p3d called forward_touch_event_to_device and renamed the existing forward_event_to_device to forward_mouse_event_to_device. This new tag will transmit touches to the virtual trackpad as touch events. I added the MultitouchTrackball to the p3d-app so zooming and moving a model remotely should now work, if you use forward_touch_event_to_device. I kept (and fixed) forward_mouse_event_to_device for background compatibility, so old presentations works as in previous versions, without the ability to zoom + scale. of course.

forward_touch_event_to_device needs some more testing, (e.g. with image-streams and keystone, afaik there’s no support for touch-events...) but for a first version it works nice.

From Kristoger Tingdahl, "the patch I sent to src/osgQt/CMakeModules.txt did not do the work on windows. I have fixed that, and also made it more generic so there is no special handling of qt5.2, but all qt5 are the same.I have tested this on:

mac/qt5.2
linux/qt5.2
windows/qt5.2, and
mac/qt5.1

All platforms perform as expected.

The previous fix removed the -f flag to the moc-pre-processor, but on windows, it turned out that -f "osgQt/QGraphicsViewer" was needed.

This becomes an include-statement in the file generated by moc which is needed for compiling it. I ask you consider this patch for the trunk and the 3.2 branch.


Secondly, I wonder if it would be possible to apply my patch for FindRSVG.cmake from 22nd November in the 3.2 branch.

In short, the version of librsvg must be equal or higher to 2.35:

PKG_CHECK_MODULES(RSVG librsvg-2.0>=2.35)

From Jordi Torres, "We have a code using gcc with -Wextra flag and using OSG as a third party library. It does not compile when importing <osgViewer/Viewer> failing in  EventHandler and GUIEventHandler:....

GUIEventHandler: In copy constructor 'osgGA::GUIEventHandler::GUIEventHandler(const osgGA::GUIEventHandler&, const osg::CopyOp&)':

/include/osgGA/GUIEventHandler:56:9: error: base class 'class osg::Object' should be explicitly initialized in the copy constructor [-Werror=extra]

It seems the diamond problem:

   A = osg::Object
  / \
 /   \--> Virtual inheritance
B     C
 \   /
  \ /
   D = EventHandler
   |
   |
   E = GUIEventHandler

The most derived class(E)  handles the instantiation of A (osg::Object), but all have to be responsible in case they are the ones instantiated.


In case A is not initialized in the copy constructor of derived classes the default constructor will be called, which seems a bug.

I've added osg::Object to the initalization list of EventHandler and GUIEventHandler copy constructors, because both classes are instantiables.

From Kristofer Tingdahl, "the syntax of the moc executable has changed between 5.1.1 and 5.2.0 versions of qt (see below). The difference is that the <file> argument has become mandatory after the -f option.Hence, moc will complain when osg throws in a -f without anything after it. Hence I propose removing the -f on Qt5 builds. I have tested building without -f on both qt520 and qt511, and that works well.

The attached src/osgQt/CMakeLists.txt that can be patched into 3.2 safely. For the trunk, I would consider dropping the check on the version, and simply remove the option on qt5. I have tested that on qt5.1.1, and that worked fine. Question is however if it works on qt5.0. Probably it does, so the question is simplicity of CMakeList.txt vs safety."

* I added a new attribute forward_to_devices for click_to_event to forward the event to all attached devices instead of handling the event locally. This will fix the annoyance with the new interface-files when toggling polygon-mode or switching light on/off.

From Farshid Lashkari, " recently encountered an issue attempting to load an IVE file generated by an older version of OSG. The file contained dxt1 compressed image data with mipmaps. The loaded model would cause crashes when passing the mipmap data to glCompressedTexImage2D. It seems that the size of the data array within the IVE file did not match the computed size from Image::getTotalSizeInBytesIncludingMipmaps(). This essentially made the mipmap offsets invalid within the Image object.I'm not sure if the IVE was simply generated incorrectly, or if the Image::getTotalSizeInBytesIncludingMipmaps() was modified since the file was generated. Either way, I added a simple check in the IVE loader so that it clears the mipmap offsets if the actual data size does not match the computed data size. This seems like a safe fallback since the mipmap data can be automatically generated, and it fixes the problem in my case.

Also, while looking into this issue, I noticed that the osgDB::InputStream class applies the serialized image allocation mode. However, since the serializer is allocating the image data itself, it seems like it should force the allocation mode to USE_NEW_DELETE.

From Andreas Henne, "in my application I use the TrackballDragger, the ScaleAxisDragger and the TranslateAxisDragger. Unfortunately these draggers are very thin and they do not provide methods to change their visual appearance. Another problem that I noticed is that lighting on the cones and boxes of the TranslateAxisDragger and ScaleAxisDragger is incorrect when the draggers are scaled due to not normalized normals. This small patch adresses these problems, providing methods to make the draggers thicker.  I have attached a zip archive containing the corresponding files and also a modified osgManipulator example that makes use of the modifications. I don't want to retain any copyright."

From Stephan Huber, "attached you’ll find a bunch of fixes + enhancements for iOS and OS X based on current trunk. I incorporated + tested the submission from Colin Cochran, so his submission is not needed anymore.* fixed a bug with multi-touch and touch-id-generation on iOS and OS X. (will fix a bug reported by Colin Cochran, without ditching the existing logic)
* removed unnecessary warning-flagss when generating xcode-projects via cmake, will enable the usage of OSG_AGGRESSIVE_WARNING_FLAGS
* added support for 10.9 (OS X)
* new cmake-variable: IPHONE_VERSION_MIN, this will set the deployment-target (previously hard-coded) If you set the IPHONE_VERSION_MIN to something like 7.0 osg gets compiled also for 64bit (amd64)
* cmake defaults now to the clang compiler if IPHONE_VERSION_MIN > 4.2
* cmake now sets some xcode-settings so the compiler uses the c++98-standard (clang defaults to c++11, w/o this I got a lot of linking errors)
* removed include-dir for avfoundation-plugin as not needed on OSX/IOS.
* enhanced the ios-example, will now show multitouch-information on a hud (similar to the  osgmultitouch-example), and more importantly, will compile + link out of the box
* small enhancements for the osc-device-plugin (send only one msg for MOVE/DRAG, even if multiple msgs/event is enabled)
* better memory-handling for the zeroconf-plugin
* fixed a possible bug in the rest-http-plugin when receiving mouse-events.
* incorporated a fix from Colin Cochran "forwarded touch events are not transformed into the GL UIView“

From Colin McDonald and Robert Osfield, "When a serializer shared library is loaded it registers all of the wrappers it contains.  The registration creates a prototype object for all of the wrapped classes.  For some of the higher-level classes this can be a bit heavy.I noticed a problem with a model which required a single class from
osgSim.  When osgdb_serializers_osgsim.so was loaded it registered
wrappers and created prototype objects for all of the osgSim classes,
including osgSim::ScalarBar.  The constructor for that class creates
several drawables, and loads arial.ttf using the freetype plugin.  I
don't need that, and don't even ship the font or plugin with my
application, resulting in an unexplained warning message loading
the model.

I've modified the ObjectWrapper class to defer the prototype object
creation until if & when actually required."

From Aurelien Albert, "I'm working with OSG and a customer low-level OpenGL library.To make easier "lazy apply" on the customer OpenGL shaders, the easiest way was to add an accessor to current OSG state's UniformMap.

I've also added accessors for modes and texture, since it could be usefull in the same way.

All methods are const, so I think there is no side-effects."

From Christopher Baker, submitted by Alberto Luacas, "there is a bug report in the Ubuntu tracker that points to a bug when loading multiple VRML files in parallel.  Christopher R. Baker has detected this bug and crafted a patch.  In addition, libcoin has to be also built with the "--enable-threadsafe" option.I copy here his report, extracted from
(https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openscenegraph/+bug/1211993)
and attach his fix.  All credit is due to him:

«
There are three instances of a classical method-local-static
multithreaded initialization bug in the Inventor plugin for OSG that
trigger various memory faults when reading multiple VRML files in
parallel via osgDB::readNodeFile. These bugs are of the form:

static std::map<Stuff,OtherStuff> myHandyMap;
static bool once = true;
if(once) { ...fill myHandyMap; once = false }
... use myHandyMap;

To repeat: try loading multiple VRML files from multiple threads. The
liklihood of the bug depends on many factors, but my application, which
parallel-loads some dozens of small (<100K) VRML files on startup,
triggers this problem 25% of the time or more.

The attached patch (inventor-plugin-multithread.patch) rectifies this
problem by:

1 - Inheriting MyHandyMap from std::map, then
2 - Moving the map initialization into the derived constructor, which
3 - Is intrinsically protected from multithread issues by g++ (and is
part of the C++ standard), unless you pass -fno-threadsafe-statics,
which is strongly discouraged by the man page.

From Adrien Grandemange, "On Windows 7 and 8, mouse messages are generated in addition to touch messages, which leads to duplicate PUSH, DRAG and RELEASE events in OSG. Besides, the mouse and touch messages referring to the same user input are not necessarily sent at the same time, due to gesture translation done by Windows by default, such as double-tap => double-click and long-push => right-click. The delay between the 2 types of messages is more noticeable on Windows 8 and leads to serious disruptions in our application.Mouse messages generated by touch input are only present for legacy support. I think they should be filtered out by OSG (real click events originating from a physical mouse will of course still go through).

This is what this patch does, according to this suggestion: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd693088%28v=VS.85%29.aspx (third issue in this page)."

From Farshid Lashkari, "I have a scene that makes heavy use of the StateSet::compare method and my profiler showed that a lot of time was being spent inside it. I made a small change to the method so that it performs a quick size comparison between the attribute/mode lists and bin mode before iterating through all the attributes. This made a noticeable improvement in my scene. I've attached the change."

From Giuseppe Donvito, "I'm using OSG 320 and I need to flush a DDS 3D texture on disk. I found a bug on DDS ReaderWriter that generates a false positive on a guard for the size check on writing operation. This is due to a wrong imageSize computation that uses img->getImageSizeInBytes() method instead of img->getTotalSizeInBytes(), that actually ignores the r() dimension, contrariwise taken into account by the function ComputeImageSizeInBytes() later.The line 1062 on file ReaderWriterDDS.cpp should be fixed with:
[code]unsigned int imageSize = img->getTotalSizeInBytes();[/code]

From Colin McDonald, "Add test for GL_EXT_framebuffer_object extension : osg uses osg::FBOExtensions to check if Frame Buffer Objects are available.  But this just checks if the fbo functions can be called. It doesn't check if the OpenGL renderer supports fbos.  For indirect rendering on linux the client side capability may be different from the display server, which can lead to mipmapped textures failing to render.  I've added a fbo extension check. "

From Wang Rui, "Some developers report that the osgviewerMFC example is broken in 3.2, in which depth test is not enabled by default so all models loaded look awkward. I submit this patch to make it work again. I haven't gone deep to check why previous example goes wrong in newer version but I believe the problem was because the newly created camera object missed some important global statesets before set as the main camera."

float cos_yaw = cosf(osg::inDegrees(yaw));

float cos_yaw = cosf(osg::inDegrees(-yaw));

The second is I had to move target_vindex and source_pindex before the PrimitiveSetList loop so they don't get reset on the next primitive (otherwise you end up with a lot of zeros in per vertex lists)."

"If you handle events in a subclass of any other UIKit responder class:
- You do not have to implement all of the event handling methods.
- In the methods you do implement, be sure to call the superclass implementation. For example, [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]."

members complained that these package is very large (indeed), so I
introduced 2 versions:
- The small version contains the dependencies for several image file formats
( tiff, png, gif, jpeg), as well as zlib, minizip, curl, freetype,  glut,
gdal and openSSL
- The full version will include all libraries which were include in the
previous releases of my 3rd party package.

Some of the included libraries are released in newer versions, so I adapted
the attached CMake module to find these renamed files.

I hope you can merge this minor changes soon, since I plan to publish the
small 3rdparty package today.

Author : Robert Osfield
From Aurelien Albert, Added support for glPrimitiveRestartIndex."The idea of this new OpenGL feature is :

- set RestartIndex = "n"
- draw elements strip
  -> when the index is "n", the strip is "stopped" and restarted

It's very usefull for drawing tiles with a single strip and a "restart" at the end of each row.

The idea a an OSG StateAttribute is :

Usually we use to build geometry from code, because software modelers rarely support it (and 3d file formats doesn't support it) :

-RootNode <= "PrimitiveRestartIndex=0"     // So now, we know that our restart index is 0 for all drawables under this node
|
- Drawable 1 : triangles => as usual
|
- Drawable 2 : triangles strip => as usual
|
- Drawable 3 : triangles strip + "GL_PRIMITIVE_RESTART" mode = ON => use the restart index
|
- Drawable 4 : triangles strip + "GL_PRIMITIVE_RESTART" mode = ON => use the restart index
|
- Drawable 5 : triangles strip => as usual


With a StateAttribute, it's easy for the developper to say "0 will be my restart index for all this object" and then activate the mode only on some nodes.

The main problem is if you set and restart index value which is not included in the vertex array (for exemple set restart index = 100 but you have only 50 vertex). There is no problem with OpenGL, but some OSG algorithms will try to access the vertex[100] and will segfault.

To solve this, I think there is two ways :

1/ add restart index in osg::PrimitiveSet and use this value in all algorithms. It's a lot of work, maybe dangerous, and it concern only a few situations : developpers who use this extension should be aware of advanced OpenGL (and OSG) data management

2/ use a StateAttribute, and choose a "correct" restart index. In my applications, I always use "0" as a restart index and duplicate the first vertex (vertex[0] = vertex[1]). So there is no difference for OpenGL and all OSG algorithms works properly.

From Christian Buchner, "Here is a strongly overhauled version of the original osgoit ("order independent transparency") by Mathias Fröhlich. I called this version myosgoit. It looks very nice, just build and run it!This version adds:

- an encapsulation of the entire Depth Peeling procedure into a class (not currently a scene graph node) for easier integration in other projects.

- compositing with opaque (solid) geometry is possible and the opaque model is only rendered once. This needs to performs some depth buffer blitting between FBOs.

- mix and match with GLSL shaders in the transparent objects is possible, as demonstrated with a 3D heat map intersecting an opaque truck model.


Some Drawbacks:

- the display framebuffer does not receive any depth information from the compositing camera. This could be fixed by compositing with a GLSL shader and writing to FragDepth."

This patch fixes the wrapper declaration so they both match properly. I ran into this problem using compressed files in an iOS application where all the libraries and plugins need to be built statically."

Introduced typedef's to make the code more readble and maintanable

Mon, 24 Jun 2013 08:48:55 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Wang Rui, "The file attached includes two new features for the serialization IO functionality. First, custom serializer version control should work now, just by defining a new REGISTER_CUSTOM_OBJECT_WRAPPER macro. For example:// A custom class
namespace CustomDomain {

class MyGroup : public osg::Group
{
public:
    META_Node( CustomDomain, MyGroup );

    void setMyName( const std::string& n );
    const std::string& getMyName() const;

    void setMyID( int id );
    int getMyID() const;

    ...
};

}

// The serialization wrapper using a custom domain name
REGISTER_CUSTOM_OBJECT_WRAPPER( MyDomain,
                                CustomDomain_MyGroup,
                                new CustomDomain::MyGroup,
                                CustomDomain::MyGroup,
                                "osg::Object osg::Node osg::Group CustomDomain::MyGroup" )
{
    ADD_STRING_SERIALIZER( MyName, std::string() );
    {
        UPDATE_TO_VERSION_SCOPED( 1 );  // Updated for a new domain version
        ADD_INT_SERIALIZER( MyID, 0 );
    }
}

Save the class instance as follows:
osgDB::writeNodeFile( *myGroup, "serializer_test.osgt", new osgDB::Options("CustomDomains=MyDomain:1") );

The output file will include the domain version definition and all the class data, and can be read back. We can also force setting the domain version by the CustomDomains option while reading the saved files. If we save the class instance without any options, MyID will be ignored because the default domain version is 0.

This may help third-party libraries like osgEarth to maintain their own serializers without regarding to the OSG soversion changes.

Another feature added is a more robust binary format, which in fact adds a size-offset at each block's beginning. When there are problems or unsupported data types while reading, we can now directly jump to the block end indicated by the offset value. So a .osgb file will automatically ignore bad data and read remains as normal (at present it will fail at all). This feature will not break the backward compatibility, and can be disabled by setting "RobustBinaryFormat=false" while writing out.

Hope these changes can work smoothly with present and future community projects. Maybe we should also consider have an osgserializer example to test and demonstrate all things we can do now."

absence of stat64, int/socklen_t differences, etc... and are in the same
line as Linux, Apple and FreeBSD specific checks.

From Juan Manuel Alvarez, "When handling keyboard events on osgQt, if a key is kept pressed, multiple sequences of KEYDOWN -> KEYUP events are fired.This is because Qt auto repeats keyboard events, so multiple calls are made to GLWidget::keyPressEvent and GLWidget::keyReleaseEvent by Qt, and subsequently translated to OSG events.

The way to solve this is ignoring key released auto repeated events (see http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qkeyevent.html#isAutoRepeat), so multiple KEYDOWN events are fired, but only one KEYUP.

I attach a modified osgQt/GraphicsWindowQt.cpp with this change."

From Jan Ciger, "I have found a problem when building OSG with Qt 5 support. Qt has the following in the qopengl.h header:# include <QtGui/qopengles2ext.h>
# ifndef GL_DOUBLE
#  define GL_DOUBLE GL_FLOAT
# endif
# ifndef GLdouble
typedef GLfloat GLdouble;
# endif

Unfortunately, when building for normal OpenGL (not GL/ES!) on Windows
with MSVC2012, GLdouble is not defined (it is not a macro but typedef)
and the code above produces a conflicting definition, making the
compile fail. I am attaching a bit hackish workaround for this problem

From Farshid Lashkari, "The logic for handling opacity maps in the 3ds reader seems to be incorrect. It checks whether the diffuse texture contains transparency, instead of the opacity texture. If the diffuse does not contain an alpha channel it outputs the warning:The plugin does not support images without alpha channel for opacity

This seems to indicate that the check for alpha should be against the opacity map. I've attached the updated file.

From Michael Bach Jensen and Robert Osfield, "As discussed (http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=12027) here is my submission :-)The following change to State.cpp fixes the case where textures in a stateset along with a compute shader program did not make those textures available to the shader, since it got evaluated before the texture bind(s)."

Note from Robert, Michael only change State::apply(StateSet*) so I also applied the same reversal in apply of texutre modes/state into the State::apply() method for consistency.

Author : Robert Osfield
From Farshid Lashkari, "I just started looking into the shader composition feature. I enabled shader composition on the osg::State object and noticed a 6x increase in draw time. I figured that the default composer might have performance issues, so I created a custom ShaderComposer that overrides "getOrCreateProgram" and does nothing. This still resulted in a performance drop.I looked into the "State::applyShaderComposition" method and noticed that it will print debug information to the osg::INFO stream. I commented that line out and the performance drop was gone.

I'm not sure if the printing was accidentally left in or is meant to be enabled. I've modified the function to only call the print function if INFO logging is enabled. I've attached the change."

From Marcin Prus and Robert Osfield, moved the key parts of the .dds plugins computeRowWidthInBytes implementation into the osg::Image::computeImageSizeInBytes(..) to address bugs in the computation of image size.

From Sukender, "Added ".dds" file deletion on writing failure."

Tue, 28 May 2013 11:46:01 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Sukender, "Added vertical flipping to the writer depending on the Image::getOrigin() value (= flip the image when Image::BOTTOM_LEFT). Most of the time this will not change DDS writing (= no v-flip), as it seems images are rarely "BOTTOM_LEFT". To skip this behaviour, the "ddsNoAutoFlipWrite" option was added. I also moved a few lines of code about "dds_flip" option, and made options reading more like in other ReaderWriters."

Tue, 28 May 2013 11:44:36 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Diane Delallée & Sukender, "Added some support of non-modulus-4 dimensions in S3TC-DXTC images (previous implementation seem just not to handle these properly). - Added missing packing value on S3TC images. Images are coded with 4x4 blocs, whatever the image size. So there is an horizontal packing of 4 pixels (2 bytes in DXT1, 4 bytes in DXT2-5). - Added crash guard against writing corrupted S3TC images. Notes: - What is missing is a support of "lines packing" in osg::Image (see code comments). - S3TC-DXTC vertical flipping crashes (access violation) with some unusual dimensions (see code). I could not implement missing cases, so I added guards to avoid crashing."

Tue, 28 May 2013 11:25:13 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Diane Delallée and Sukender, "1. Image.cpp Failure to perform a vertical flip on S3TC-DXTC now simply leaves the original image instead of corrupting it. Image.cpp was sometimes performing a "normal" (= for uncompressed images) vertical flip on S3TC-DXTC images, producing weird results. Actually, code was trying a "DXTC vertical flip" and relied on the result to call a "normal vertical flip". But when the "DXTC v-flip" encounters an error, this is is not necessarily because the image is not S3TC (ex: unhandled image dimensions)! So now the code simply does "if dxtc, then flip_dxtc; else flip_normal;".Note from Robert Osfield, moved the isDXT function into the dxt_tool file and namespace.

From Pawel Ksiezopolski, first email: "This submission adds texture buffer object ( defined in GL_ARB_texture_buffer_object extension ) to the osg::Texture* family.TextureBuffer objects may use osg::Texture::bindToImageUnit(), so GLSL shaders are able to use not only texelFetch() function , but also functions defined in GL_ARB_shader_image_load_store extension : imageLoad(), imageStore(), imageAtomicAdd() etc."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Farshid Lashkari, "I'm working on a custom ShaderComposer and I need access to the full StateSetStack of the State object within the getOrCreateProgram() method. The problem is that  "State::apply(const StateSet* dstate)" does not add the specified stateset to the stack. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but I've updated the function to push/pop the stateset.I hope the change seems reasonable. I searched the entire code base for code that accesses the StateSetStack, and noticed RenderBin and RenderStage use it. However, I don't think that code would ever be called from within the State::apply() function, so I'm fairly confident the change should be safe."

From Lionel Lagarde, "When a function do:OSG_DEBUG << "Hello world!\n";

the underlying stream is not automatically flushed. It is flushed
if endl is queued instead of \n:

OSG_DEBUG << "Hello world!" << std::endl;


The notify macros do:
stream->setCurrentSeverity(severity);
return *stream;

So, if a function do:

OSG_DEBUG << "This is a debug message\n";
OSG_NOTICE << "This is a notice message" << std::endl;

the debug message will be classified as a notice message.

It is a problem when the application uses a NotifyHandler. The notify
method of the handler is called with:

severity = NOTICE
message = "This is a debug message\nThis is a notice message"

The attached Notify.cpp contains an automatic flush of the stream when
the current severity changes.

From Wee See, Support for importing OpenFlight Surface Material Codes using osg::Object::UserValue.  Notes from Wee See:See attached my ported code, which fulfills:

- using of setUserValue()/getUserValue()
- user-value will be attached to Geode or Drawable
- actually 3 values will be added: SMC (surface), FID (feature) and IRC (IRcolor). Its UserValue-names are < UA:SMC >, < UA:FID > and < UA:IRC > (without spaces!)
- user-value will be attached to Geode or Drawable
- has an option (named preserveNonOsgAttrsAsUserData) for control whether the UserValues should be attached (Default: no UserValues will be attached)

Reading out this values is very simple. Here is an example (uservalue-name without spaces!):

signed short smc;
if (myGeode.getUserValue("< UA:SMC >", smc))
{
  doSomethingWithTheGeodeAndItsSmc(myGeode, smc);
}
else
{
  // geode has no SMC
}

Added TODO note about RGB -> RGBA

Wed, 6 Feb 2013 12:46:03 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From David Longest, "I have updated the FFmpeg plugin to  support the 1.0 release version of FFmpeg. The files attached were modified in order to facilitate the update. Below are the details for all changes made.Header update

FindFFmpeg.cmake has been changed in order to support the new header include format for FFmpeg. In the 1.0 release, a new file had been added with the name “time.h” in the avutil library. The previous method of adding includes caused conflicts with the ANSI C “time.h” file. Now the include directive will only use the main include folder. All files using the old include format have been updated to reflect the change.



Added __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS define to CMakeLists.txt

Since there is no guarantee that FFmpegHeaders.hpp will be included before stdint.h is included, the define has been moved from FFmpegHeaders.hpp to be part of the CMakeLists.txt for the FFmpeg plugin. This will allow the define to work on all compilers regardless of include order.



Replaced AVFormatParameters with AVDictionary

AVFormatParameters is no longer supported in FFmpeg and has been replaced with a key/value map of strings for each setting. FFmpegParameters and FFmpegDecoder has been updated to reflect this.



Replaced av_open_input_file with avformat_open_input

FFmpeg now opens files using avformat_open_input. Since the av_open_input_file method is deprecated, the FFmpegDecoder class has been updated to reflect this change.



Added custom AVIOContext field to options

Since some formats and inputs may not be supported by FFmpeg, I have added a new parameter that allows a user to allocate their own AVIOContext. This class will allow for creating a read, seek, and write callback if they desire.



Checking for start_time validity

It is possible for some file formats to not provide a start_time to FFmpeg. This would cause stuttering in the video since the clocks class would be incorrect.



Removed findVideoStream and findAudioStream

The new FFmpeg release already has a function that will find the best audio and video stream. The code has been replaced with this function.



Updated error reporting

Some functions would not log an error when opening a file or modifying a file failed. New logs have been added as well as a function to convert error numbers to their string descriptions.



decode_video has been replaced

The old decode_video function would remove extra data that some decoders use in order to properly decode a packet. Now av_codec_decode_video2 has replaced that function.



Picture format changed from RGBA32 to RGB24

Since most video will not contain an alpha channel, using a 24 bit texture will use less memory."

The mouse-coordinates get reprojected * present3d: all devices get registered with the viewer * osgViewer: only devices which are capable of receiving events are queried for new events. * GraphicWindowIOS: added a flag to GraphicWindowIOS::WindowData to set up a retained backing buffer (defaults to false) This will enable read-back of the render-buffer with glReadPixels even after the renderbuffer got presented * curl: added an optimized check for file-existance, now only the headers are requested and checked, instead of reading the whole file and handle it with a ReaderWriter * p3d: fixed a bug, where the existence of a local file may prevent the remote loading of a file with the same name."

From Juergen Rensen, "This is a fix for the latest SVN version (rev 13269). The ‘destroyFrameBuffer’ method in ‘GraphicsWindowIOS.mm’ had ‘glDeleteFramebuffersOES’ calls for the stencil buffer, MSAA render buffer and MSAA depth buffer instead of ‘glDeleteRenderbuffersOES’. The fix changes the mismatched calls to ‘glDeleteRenderbuffersOES’.The impact of the bug was a memory leak that would affect multi-sampling iOS apps that allow for device rotation or window resizing in general. For our app, the leak ranged from ca. 10 MB to 40 MB per device rotation, depending on device, for the MSAA buffers. I have not been able to confirm impact for the stencil buffer. "

From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a zip containing some bug-fixes and some refactored + new code.* ZeroConfDevice does now return FILE_NOT_HANDLED instead of FILE_NOT_FOUND
* present3D supports multiple devices per env-var P3D_DEVICE, separate multiple device with a space

I refactored parts the p3d-plugin, the curl-plugin and parts of Registry and ReaderWriter. Currently the p3d-plugin tries to open all remote files with the help of the curl-plugin.

I added a new method to Registry called getReaderWriterForProtocolAndExtension. which will return a ReaderWriter which is capable in handling the remote file for the given protocol and extension. If no readerwriter is found for the given extension, a list is built of all readerwriters supporting the given protocol and this list is checked for support of wildcards (extension = "*"). If anything matches it get returned.

I added this principle also to the Registry, so now it's possible to register a generic ReaderWriter which can handle all filetypes for a given protocol, similar what curl is doing. All you have to do is to load the plugin at startup. The curl-fallback is still in place.

With these changes it is now possible to reference a movie inside a presentation without a server-address, read the presentation (with curl) and stream the movie with the correct plugin (e.g. QTKit)

From David Longest, "When drawing, a transform with an absolute reference frame will ignore the calculated model / view matrices up to that point. The IntersectionVisitor would instead keep the view matrices calculated up to that point even though the Transform class will throw out the calculated model matrix via “computeLocalToWorldMatrix.”The change I made will push an identity matrix as the view matrix when running into a transform
with an absolute reference frame and will pop the matrix off after the traverse.

To test this, I created a camera with a perspective view and added a transform with some geometry
in it. Afterwards, I set the transform’s reference frame to ABSOLUTE_RF and spun the camera around
using the trackball manipulator. When trying to pick with a LineSegmentIntersector, it would not
pick the geometry in the transform with the reference frame set to ABSOLUTE_RF."

From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find the latest versions of the QTKit + the AVFoundation-plugin, some changes to osgPresentation and a small enhancement für ImageIO.I fixed some bugs and did some more tests with both of the video-plugins. I integrated CoreVideo with osgPresentation, ImageStream has a new virtual method called createSuitableTexture which returns NULL for default implementations. Specialized implementations like the QTKit-plugin return a CoreVideo-texture. I refactored the code in SlideShowConstructor::createTexturedQuad to use a texture returned from ImageStream::createSuitableTexture.

I did not use osgDB::readObjectFile to get the texture-object, as a lot of image-related code in SlideShowConstructor had to be refactored to use a texture.  My changes are minimal and should not break existing code.

There's one minor issue with CoreVideo in general: As the implementation is asynchronous, there might be no texture available, when first showing the video the first frame. I am a bit unsure how to tackle this problem, any input on this is appreciated.

Back to the AVFoundation-plugin: the current implementation does not support CoreVideo as the QTKit-plugin supports it. There's no way to get decoded frames from AVFoundation stored on the GPU, which is kind of sad. I added some support for CoreVideo to transfer decoded frames back to the GPU, but in my testings the performance was worse than using the normal approach using glTexSubImage. This is why I disabled CoreVideo for AVFoundation. You can still request a CoreVideoTexture via readObjectFile, though.

From Oren Fromberg, "" --This line, and thosAttached is an update to ReaderWriterDAE.cpp/h and daeReader.cpp/h that implementsosgDB::ReaderWriter::ReadResult

ReaderWriterDAE::readNode (std::istream&, const osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options*)

This virtual function had never been implemented in ReaderWriterDAE. I implemented this function because the DAE plugin could not load files from other ReaderWriter derived objects that use protocol handlers.

I have updated function declarations in the header to have identical signatures with the base class declarations that include the default parameter.


readNode (std::istream&, …) is nearly identical to readNode(const std::string &, …) except it uses a new private function to convert the file from standard input:

bool daeReader::convert( std::istream& fin )

When this function is called fileURI is the string “from std::istream” to make the user aware where the file is coming from. Then instead of calling

_dae->open(fileURI)

we call

_dae->openFromMemory(fileURI, buffer.data())

Where buffer.data() is a pointer to the dae file text in memory.


Other changes include private functions to clear caches and to consolidate redundant code that appears between the two convert functions.

http://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/KTX/

The attached plugin can read:

* 1D, 2D, and 3D textures
* uncompressed and compressed images
* mipmapped and non-mipmapped textures
* little-endian and big-endian files
* textures from files as well as seekable istream objects

It does not handle:

* array textures (not supported by the ReaderWriter API)
* cubemap textures (not supported by the ReaderWriter API)
* the "KTXorientation" key-value pair; support could be added later (see
the file format spec for more information)
* non-seekable istream objects (would require more complicated memory
management)

From Leigh Stivers, "We had this problem which shows up with nVidia's latest Quadro driver, 305.93 - and older drivers when the nVidia's setting "Thread Optimization" was turned on, running Windows 7.   The symptom, is that after creating a first view and using it, and then creating a second view, the first view will never render anything but black.What happens is this:
A view is created, and then the viewers thread is created and runs.
The setReleaseContextAtEndOfFrameHint is true.
To create a second view, the viewer is setDone(true), and we wait for the thread exit.

At this point, inside the ViewerBase::RenderingTraversals code, there are places where it reads "if(_done) return;"

The problem, is that it won't reach the code that will releaseContext().

Apparently, this driver won't let any other thread to makeCurrent(), if another thread (dead or not) has ownership.  So when the Viewers is re-started, the first view won't be able to use the gc.

The change attached (against rev 13153) corrects this."

Thu, 6 Sep 2012 13:48:17 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Piotr Domagalski, "I've rewritten some bits of the STL plugin in order to support ASCII STL files with multiple named solids (reading and writing). The names are also used as OSG nodes names.- Also, a 'dontSaveNormals' was added. It allows to ignore normals when writing an STL file. For example, it is useful for me when writing an STL file for CFD simulations.

- Some comments and code formatting were improved (to be consistent with the formatting already used in the plugin).

- With 'separateFiles' option files are now named fooX.stl instead of foo.stlX

The changes have been tested on various STL, both ASCII and binary found on the net. The change was based on the trunk branch."

From Robert Osfield, changed assert in Piotr's code to a runtime check warning report.

From Piotr Domagalski, "Currently, code using OpenSceneGraph doesn't build with clang due to the way __sync_bool_compare_and_swap() is used in OpenThreads/Atomic header file.I tested it with clang 3.1 and it seems that clang is enforcing the use of the same type for all parameters in this builtin. Looking at the function declaration [1]

bool __sync_bool_compare_and_swap (type *ptr, type oldval type newval, ...)

it seems to be doing the right thing: here the same type is used for *ptr, oldval and newval.

Author : Robert Osfield
From Andreas Ekstrand, The attached ESRIShape.cpp contains fixes for comparing calculated byte sizes with the content length from the record header. According to the ESRI Shape documentation (http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf), the content length is specified in 16 bit words, which is why I have multiplied it by 2 when comparing to byte sizes. Note that the comparison in line 813 is made with a fix number of 16-bit words so it hasn't been changed.This fixes problems with PolygonZ records where the previous code was reading past the end of the record since it thought it had M values even if it didn't. I suspect the problem that James McGlone had back in 2006 was the same but reversed, when he tried to simply comment out the check, which was a (correctly) refused submission.""

The reason for this is that the default OSG tab sizes are way bigger than
those we used in our application so far. And since handleScaleFactor_
is already a (constant) class member, I see no objection against making
it user defined."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Luc Frauciel, "I've encoutered a nasty group of dae which are incompatible with dae plugins (and probably collada schema ) in 4 different ways :1)  they use direct link to texture

-> this is already handle by current plugin : OK

2)  they defined colors with only 3 color components

->  it leads to a crash when trying to acces to the fourth component
 I fixed that

3)  they contain empty primitive lists

-> reading is ok, but osgviewer crashes when trying to display the geometries
The reason is that osg assume that  DrawElementsare never empty (blunt acces to DrawElements.front() in PrimitiveSet.cpp)
I corrected this (on the plugin side), but I wonder :
Is it the responsability of plugins to create non empty DrawElements, or of osg core not to crash when they occur ?
If the responsability is on the osg core side, I can submit a patch to PrimitiveSet.cpp regarding that aspect.

4)  they use a material binding scheme not supported by the plugin

->I've implemented a mechanism to handle this binding scheme

You will also find in the patch an example of these evil dae and comments on the offending elements.
They seems to be produced by ComputaMaps (www.computamaps.com)
They load well in Google Earth

Fri, 23 Mar 2012 10:24:50 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Ulrich Hertlein, "as discussed on osg-users there is an issue with clang++ on OS X and iOS that results in the following error:Users/stephan/Documents/Projekte/cefix/cefix/ios/../../libs/ios/include/OpenThreads/Atomic:244:48:
error: cannot initialize a parameter of type 'void *' with an lvalue of
type 'const void *const'
   return __sync_bool_compare_and_swap(&_ptr, ptrOld, ptrNew);

This can be solved by a cast to '(void*)ptrOld'.  This should be benign since both
'ptrOld' and 'ptrNew' are only read and the cast is in fact in place for all other
implementations as well.

On OS X the cast compiles cleanly on both g++ (i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-g++-4.2 (GCC)
4.2.1) and clang++ (Apple clang version 3.1 (tags/Apple/clang-318.0.54)).

Fri, 23 Mar 2012 10:18:27 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Erik den Dekker, " IF(${CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT} STREQUAL "/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk") ...            ELSEIF(${CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT} STREQUAL "/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk" OR ${CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT} STREQUAL "/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk")

...

ELSEIF(EXISTS /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk)
...

            ELSE()

...

            ENDIF()


Which is fragile because XCode could be installed into another directory than /Developer. (In case XCode is not installed into the /Developer directory CMake can automatically resolve the path via command line utility ${CMAKE_XCODE_SELECT} --print-path)

This issue bites me currently because the latest XCode (Version 4.3.1 - 4E1019) installed through the Mac App Store is per default installed in "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer" and hence the 10.7 SDK in "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk"

Searching the web to find the proper way to determine the version of the Platform SDK programmatically, I found no standard way. I came up with 2 options myself:

1) Parse the path string to extract the version number

2) Read a value from the SDKSettings.plist found in the root of each SDK  (e.g., "defaults read ${CMAKE_OSX_ROOT}/SDKSettings.plist CanonicalName" gives "macosx10.7")

I implemented the last option and verified that at least the following Mac OS SDKs (10.3.9, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7) support this method. It also looks reasonably future proof. An additional benefit of this method is that it also seems to be compatible with iOS and iOS Simulator SDKs (at least for version 5.1, but I assume this also applies to older versions). This is interesting because the CMake infrastructure to build OSG for iOS currently still contains similar hard-coded paths and even requires you to manually change the cmake file to build for another iOS SDK version. In the near future I hope to address these issues, but I haven't been able to try this yet."

From Wang Rui, "I'd like to submit a slightly modified version of the ViewDependentShadowMap. It includes two fixes: one is in ComputeLightSpaceBounds::update(), which changes the statement "if (v.z()<0.0f)" to "if (v.z()<-1.0f)" as clipping space coordinates should be transformed to [-1, 1] and should not be discarded unless they go beyond the range; the other is in ViewDependentShadowMap::computeShadowCameraSettings(), in which I changed the line: viewMatrix.makeLookAt(frustum.center+positionedLight.lightDir*zMin, frustum.center, lightUp); to viewMatrix.makeLookAt(frustum.center+positionedLight.lightDir*zMin, frustum.center+positionedLight.lightDir*zMax, lightUp);The reason I've done such a change is that for huge scenes like a city on the earth, the values of frustum.center can be extremely large, but zMin may be very small (e.g., when model depth in light coords equals the model radius by chance) in some cases so the result of (eye - center) might jiggle while moving around the shadow scene and thus make the shadow map suddenly disappear some time. The small change here also considers the effect of zMax to avoid such problems.

From Chuck Seberino, "Attached are modified versions of RotateCylinderDragger and Projector files that clean up the use of _onCylinder / isProjectionOnCylinder().I have also made changes to the RotateCylinderDragger to provide a cylinder ring with a thickness.   It is totally optional, but IMHO makes the default behavior work better than a solid cylinder (which typically obscures the geometry you are trying to drag).  Gives it a bit more to grab, especially in the case where eyepoint and cylinder axis are near parallel.

Author : Robert Osfield
From Chuck Seberino, "Here is a fix for the RotateCylinderDragger.  This patch fixes the case where the picking direction is close to the cylinder axis.  The current behavior is this:* If the eyepoint and cylinder axis are close to parallel (given some tolerance), then it uses a plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis.
* Otherwise it uses a plane parallel to the cylinder axis oriented towards the eyepoint (previous behavior).  This gives decent behavior and is the only path that was taken in the previous code.   I kept with previous behavior and that allowed a good bit of code to be removed, simplifying things.  There is now no need for the _onCylinder flag, but since there is a public accessor, I wasn't sure how to handle it for backwards compatibility, so I left it in.  NOTE - there is no default initialized value, so if it is kept in, it should be set to 'false' to keep same behavior as before.  I am not quite sure how the _onCylinder case was supposed to behave as even forcing that path gave undesirable behavior, even with carefully controlled dragging.

From Guillaume Millet, "When using the texture Atlas builder, it will convert from REPEAT to CLAMP all textures using only texcoord between [-0.001 1.001] to give a chance to create an Atlas. If the atlas creation failed for other reason (texture size, only one compatible texture, ...) the texture remain modified in CLAMP mode.But if you use texcoords between [0.0 1.0] using CLAMP mode instead
REPEAT it is not safe because you will have a blend to the border color
at extremities.
If we want to have exactly the same rendering after changing mode from
REPEAT to CLAMP we should use the CLAMP_TO_EDGE mode instead of CLAMP to
avoid blending to border color at extremities.

Please find as attachment the proposed patch against latest svn version.

  typedef std::vector<osg::ref_ptr<A> > AList;

{
       ADD_LIST_SERIALIZER(A,Bug::A::AList);
}


Bug:
We create say 3 instances of class A: A1,A2,A3 and then we add A2 and A3 and A1 as child instances of A1 so we get next structure:
A1
 |- A2,A3,A1

we call osgDB::writeObjectFile(A1,"/data/a.osgt") -> saved correctly( third element in list is saved as unique id that references parentClass

now we call
A1 = osgDB::readObjectFile("/data/a.osgt");

Everything is deserialized correctely except last element in list which should be same instance as parent A1.

The attached code resolves this issue by passing UniqueID in readObjectFields method and saving object in _identifierMap as soon as we have valid object instance so we can make reference to parent object from any child instance.

but the comment dates back to 2004...
What's more I believe that it's correct to expect a floating texture format if you're loading an hdr image.
It was quite troublesome for us to discover why our background image wasn't showing hdr data...

From Colin McDonald, "Upgrading to OpenSceneGraph 3.0.1, texture mip mapping stopped working on some junk low-end graphics cards which I still have to support.  They worked ok with osg 2.8 and earlier.The problem turned out to be with gl proxy textures, which are
unreliable on those devices.  Proxy textures are used by the glu
mipmap build routines to determine if a texture size is
supported. The external glu library had a nice fallback
behaviour, so that if proxy textures didn't work then the mipmap
texture was still created.  But in the work on the new embedded
glu routines that fallback behaviour has been inadvertently
lost.  I have restored the fallback in
src/osg/glu/libutil/mipmap.cpp.  It doesn't add any extra
complexity."

OpenSceneGraph-3.0.1/src/osgPlugins/xine/video_out_rgb.c:2773:25:
error: ?video_driver_class_t? has no member named ?get_description?

This has been reported on Gentoo: https://bugs.gentoo.org/397643
The relevant commit to the xine-lib repository is
http://anonscm.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/xine-lib-1.2/diff/806b590a4d38/src/xine-engine/video_out.h

This change addresses the issue. I'm sending the full modified file as
an attachment. It is based on the 3.0.1 release of OSG. I'll also paste
a diff below. You will find a colorized view in the Gentoo bugzilla.

The xine-lib API changed in the following way: the identifier and
description members are now "const char*" strings instead of "char*
(*)(video_driver_class_t*)" getter function. As the functions in the osg
plugin will always simply return a string literal, without accessing
their argument, it is safe to simply call them with a NULL argument and
use the returned string. This makes it easy to support both API
versions. When you drop support for older xine one day, you might want
to move the string literals to the assignment, getting rid of the
functions in the process.

The modified code compiles for me. I'm not sure how to test it, as I've
only got OSG around in order to build (and hopefully one day even use)
Flightgear.

I'm assigning my copyright in this change to the osg project leads.

From Thorsten Brehm, "attached update changes OSG's src/osgDB/Registry.cpp, so it doesn't (accidentally) resolve relative paths against the current working directory when searching for resources. So far, such paths were always resolved against the cwd first.I guess the previous behaviour of giving the cwd precedence over any path configured in the "database path list" (osgDB::Options) wasn't intentional. Otherwise, if it was intentional after all, it'd be good to add another feature instead, to make this configurable - e.g. a flag in osgDB::Options to disable this, if an application doesn't want the cwd being considered.
"

Note from Robert Osfield, this submission will change the default behaviour of searching for files so can potentially break existing applications as it
won't search the current working direction unless it's included in the DataFilePathList entry in the Options or Registy.  I'll add a follow
up submission to add back in this feature.

From Leandro Motto Barros,"I've made a few changes to osgUtil::PolytopeIntersector so that it
actually uses double precision floating point numbers everywhere (as
long as OSG_USE_FLOAT_PLANE is not defined).

I needed double precision intersections in a project I am working on.
These changes fixed the problems I was having -- this is all testing I
have done.

Notice that I have changed
osgUtil::PolytopeIntersector::Intersection's members to use doubles
(osg::Vec3d, instead of osg::Vec3). I could have added #ifdef's there
too, but I think it is better to not change the types of stuff in the
public interface depending on some preprocessor definition.

The modified files are attached. A diff also follows, for those who like it."

With the following changes from Robert Osfield:

"I've just reviewed your changes and have just tweaked them a little to
streamline them.  What I have done in the PolytopeIntersector header
is add:

       typedef osg::Plane::Vec3_type Vec3_type;

And then use this typedef in the definition of the vertices rather
then Vec3d as you did.  Next changes were to PolytopeInteresector.cpp
where to the PolytopeIntersectorUtils defintions of the Vec3_type, and
value_type which now simply read:

   typedef osg::Plane::Vec3_type Vec3_type;
   typedef Vec3_type::value_type value_type;

This way I was able to complete avoid any if def's and have essential
the same implementation as you achieved.  Changes now checked into
svn/trunk."

typedef, and allocates one _tobj instead of one per tesellation.
Protections were added to check that _tobj was allocated in the few
remaining places it wasn't being checked.

---
On a side note, I would like to avoid the 'new Vec3d' in
Tessellator::addVertex for each call to
gluTessVertex(tess, location, data).
The RedBook leaves it ambiguous if the location pointer must
remain valid after gluTessVertex or not.
http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/gluTessVertex.xml
says that changing location is not safe, so being conservative, I'll
leave it as is, even though the Mesa GLU library copies the data not
the pointer, so it is currently safe."

From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a first version of multi-touch-support for OS X (>= 10.6), which will forward all multi-touch events from a trackpad to the corresponding osgGA-event-structures.The support is switched off per default, but you can enable multi-touch
support via a new flag for GraphicsWindowCocoa::WindowData or directly
via the GraphicsWindowCocoa-class.

After switching multi-touch-support on, all mouse-events from the
trackpad get ignored, otherwise you'll have multiple events for the same
pointer which is very confusing (as the trackpad reports absolute
movement, and as a mouse relative movement).

I think this is not a problem, as multi-touch-input is a completely
different beast as a mouse, so you'll have to code your own
event-handlers anyway.

While coding this stuff, I asked myself if we should refactor
GUIEventAdapter/EventQueue and assign a specific event-type for
touch-input instead of using PUSH/DRAG/RELEASE. This will make it
clearer how to use the code, but will break the mouse-emulation for the
first touch-point and with that all existing manipulators. What do you
think? I am happy to code the proposed changes.

Additionally I created a small (and ugly) example osgmultitouch which
makes use of the osgGA::MultiTouchTrackballManipulator, shows all
touch-points on a HUD and demonstrates how to get the touchpoints from
an osgGA::GUIEventAdapter.

From J.P. Delport, "when switching from windowed mode to fullscreen (with the 'f' key) in X11, no RESIZE event is generated. This confuses handlers that perform some processing on the RESIZE event, e.g. the InteractiveImageHandler.To reproduce the problem I attach a minimally modified osgviewer that just prints resize events. You can check what's printed in the console when you go fullscreen and windowed a few times.

The attached version of GraphicsWindowX11 fixes the problem for me, but I'm not sure this is the right approach. Maybe you can see a fix for the problem clearer.

The only place where the RESIZE event is generated in GraphicsWindowX11 is in CheckEvents and it then depends on the ConfigureNotify message. For some reason, either ConfigureNotify is not sent when going fullscreen or the traits already reflect the latest window size."

Added support for using GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH in conjunction with texture's + osg::Image via new RowLength parameter in osg::Image.  To support this Image::setData(..) now has a new optional rowLength parameter which defaults to 0, which provides the original behaviour, Image::setRowLength(int) and int Image::getRowLength() are also provided.With the introduction of RowLength support in osg::Image it is now possible to create a sub image where
the t size of the image are smaller than the row length, useful for when you have a large image on the CPU
and which to use a small portion of it on the GPU.  However, when these sub images are created the data
within the image is no longer contiguous so data access can no longer assume that all the data is in
one block.  The new method Image::isDataContiguous() enables the user to check whether the data is contiguous,
and if not one can either access the data row by row using Image::data(column,row,image) accessor, or use the
new Image::DataIterator for stepping through each block on memory assocatied with the image.

To support the possibility of non contiguous osg::Image usage of image objects has had to be updated to
check DataContiguous and handle the case or use access via the DataIerator or by row by row.  To achieve
this a relatively large number of files has had to be modified, in particular the texture classes and
image plugins that doing writing.

From Wojciech Lewandowski, "There was a bug in reading modifier keys when focus to GraphicsWindowWin32  was restored. Handler of WM_SETFOCUS was reading pressed keys and sending WM_KEYDOWN messages to fill initial keyboard state. But WM_KEYDOWN messages sent had  0 on lParam and adaptKey method computing state of modifier mask was using lParam to find which modifier keys are down. Obviously when lParam was 0 it was not recording proper modifier masks.This patch fixes this code sending proper lParam and also makes sure LEFT_CONTROL will be not confused with RIGHT_CONTROL."

enum SampleFormat   (in include/osg/AudioStream) for anything but
SAMPLE_FORMAT_U8 and SAMPLE_FORMAT_S16
"

and follow up that address versioning issue

"I can find the change, avutil version 50.38.0 introduced a new header file:
libavutil/samplefmt.h
older versions use
libavcodec/avcodec.h
with the sampleformats without AV_

an intermideate fix with the FF_API_OLD_SAMPLE_FMT is removed from ffmpeg 0.8.3 so
I think this is the correct fix:

#if LIBAVUTIL_VERSION_INT < AV_VERSION_INT(50,38,0)
#define AV_SAMPLE_FMT_NONE SAMPLE_FMT_NONE
#define AV_SAMPLE_FMT_U8   SAMPLE_FMT_U8
#define AV_SAMPLE_FMT_S16  SAMPLE_FMT_S16

I use(d) this method to make a simple algorithm to tell how much visible an object was in percent.So with the 3.0 api change we propose the following change:
- put OSG_EXPORT on the QueryGeometry class so that we get access to the getNumPixels method.
- Create a function called getQueryGeometry that returns a casted _queryGeode->getDrawable(). Or a function called getQueryGeode that returns _queryGeode."

From Robert Milharcic, "This will hopefully fix some issues with osgQt, more precisely with GLWidget event handling. There are at least two current GL context braking events, QEvent::Hide and QEvent::ParentChange. When running in a multithreaded mode they both try  to change current GL context in a wrong thread (main GUI thread). The QEvent::ParentChange is also problematic when running in a single threaded model because Qt is going to release current contex then delete it, and then it will create new one, and as a result the osg will continue to render to an invalid deleted context. This changes workaround above problems by deferring execution of the problematic evens. These events has to be enqueued and executed later.  The enqueued event processing is currently done right after swap in a swapBuffersImplementation of GraphicsWindowQt while code is running in a render thread by calling QGLWidget handler directly. In principle the deferred events queue should be executed while in GUI thread but I couldn't find any reliable way to do this, that is without risking a deadlock. For now it is assumed, Qt is not going to execute any GUI thread only operations inside the QGLWidget handler."

From Farshid Lashkari, " The osgUtil::CullVisitor class will display an OSG_INFO notification when attempting to clamp the projection matrix with invalid near/var values. This usually appears when the scene graph is empty or all objects are culled. I don't think this scenario warrants having this message appear every frame. It makes it very difficult to debug other issues when this notification floods the output window.I'd prefer to have the notification removed, but there might be legitimate cases where you want this displayed. Instead, I just disabled the output if the near/far values are equal to FLT_MAX (their initial values). This should at least prevent the notification for the common case where everything was culled."

I tried solving the problem by commenting a line in CMFC_OSG_MDIView::OnKeyDown() and it seems to work now.Another improvement here is to use a thread class derived from
OpenThreads to replace the old _beginthread(). It helps a lot in
keeping a high frame rate when you open more than one MDI child
windows. And the application using OpenThreads in my opinion will be
more compatible and portable."

From Torben Dannhauer, "originally I posted the addendum of 'freetype244MT', but that was wrong. I updated it to the correct addendum of 'freetype244' yesterday, but supposedly that was not forwarded to you by the forum-to-mail-gateway.Find attached the corrected CMake module. "

Fixed redundant "enumeration not handled in switch" warnings. Fixed a warning about a comparison between different enums - EUnifiedMappingType was being compared with EMappingType. In general the FBX SDK is moving away from Get & Set functions to giving direct access to properties, so I have changed GetMappingType() to CurrentMappingType.Get()

From John Cummings, "While testing recent OSG developer releases and the subversion trunk, I have noticed that on my 64-bit Linux machines, all of the OSG libraries get installed into the "lib64" directory as I would expect. However, the OpenThreads library gets installed into the "lib" directory when selecting "Build OpenThreads with Qt threading support." That is, with the BUILD_OPENTHREADS_WITH_QT set to ON.I am attaching the a fix for this issue in the file:

src/OpenThreads/qt/CMakeLists.txt

It simply adds ${LIB_POSTFIX} to the destination as in done with all
other CMakeLists.txt with libraries in OSG. I have tested it on both
32-bit and 64-bit Linux."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Jorge Ciges, "two clean example viewers (GLES1/2) that permit load models withouth recompiling by options in the menu and some basic options. basic options.As Rafa and I told you earlier this can't be integrated in the CMAKE chain. It needs to be compiled by the user out of the OSG standard compilation. It could be stored in the examples. That way users will not come here asking for the examples.

Main characteristics are:

-Menu with loading and unloading by path.
-Return to home view
-Keyboard capabilities with manipilator switch and basic state changing.
-Change color screen.
-Osg log bypassed to LogCat (This comes practically straight from Marcin Hajder example I've only added personal TAG)
-Earmbi / Earmbi V7
-Install to SD (if the device supports the feature)

And that's all. Now I'm looking to fix the environmental mapping with true GLES (it does not work well in Android) I will try to make it in time for 3.0. The other work that i'm studying Dynamic build with Android but that will need a lot of time to test.

Tue, 7 Jun 2011 14:28:58 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Sukender, "Lastest change (update to FBX 2012.1) introduced a regression. It didn't take materials' order into consideration. The line    lMaterialLayer->GetDirectArray().SetAt(it->second.getIndex(), lMaterial); has been replaced by    _curFbxNode->AddMaterial(lMaterial); because KFbxLayerElementMaterial::GetDirectArray() is now private and we can't access to it. However, pushing back the material at the end of the vector is wrong. We can use the (now) public attribute KFbxLayerElementMaterial::mDirectArray, as in this submission. "

Author : Robert Osfield
From Ryan Pavlik, "Existing osgconv behavior is to transform the model bounding sphere center to the world origin before performing transformations specified on the command line, and translating back after rotation and scaling unless an alternate translation is specified. This patch adds a setting to the OrientationConverter class in osgconv to disable this extra transformation, which has the effect of applying specified transforms with respect to the input world coordinate system, rather than to the center of the bounding sphere. It also adds a command line argument "--use-world-frame" to enable this behavior. When this command line argument is not passed, behavior is unchanged from before the patch. The usage text has been updated to reflect this additional option, and the comments in OrientationConverter are also updated."Note from Robert Osfield, tweaked the OrientationConverter.cpp a little to improve readability.

-- Options to set the XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTION tags (DPI) in the TIFF file.

"This means that the empty stream is seeked again resulting in the fail bit to be set. Your code does not check this case, furthermore you use t_off instead of std::ostream::streampos for the tellp() calls. In this special case (empty stream) tellp() returns -1 which is cast to 0xFFFFFFFFFF as t_off is unsigned. I suggest this addition to your code (within the switch statement)"

From Bradley Anderegg, "Ok, I am re-submitting this with the changes we discussed.  That is, there is a default implementation of osgDB::Archive::getDirectoryContents() that uses getFileNames(), and the osgDB::ArchiveExtended header was removed as it is now unnecessary.Here is a quick list of the modified files:

Archive - getDirectoryContents() no longer pure virtual
Archive.cpp - default getDirectoryContents() implementation
unzip.cpp - modified to fix a bug where the same file will not load twice in a row
ZipArchive.h / ZipArchive.cpp - extends osgDB::Archive and provides support for random access loading within a .zip file
ReaderWriterZip.cpp - modified to use the ZipArchive class"

From Sukender, I wrapped my change about non-empty texture units in an off-by-default option, so that it doesn't break any existing code. But AFAIK, other readers (except OSGx) generate contiguous texture units, so I guess this option to be useful for users.Other changes in this sumbission include the added ability to tessellate polygons in Collada reader, with appropriate options.
 - No tessellation
 - Tessellate as triangle fan (previous behaviour, kept as default for backward-compatibility)
 - Full tessellation

I also put auto_ptr<> for RAII of DAE structure (as discussed), and moved reader options in a structure, as for the writer.

Code also make use of osgDB::ExternalFileWriter I submitted, so please merge this submission after the PluginImageWriter one.

From Jan Peciva, I have improved GraphicsWindowQt:- renamed osgQt::GraphWidget to osgQt::GLWidget
as it better fits to Qt naming (osgQt::GLWidget is derived from QGLWidget
while recent GraphWidget... it is unclear, maybe QGraphicsView,
QGraphicsScene,....)
- added the code to properly manage ON_DEMAND rendering scheme
(involves osgQt::setViewer() and internal HeartBeat class)
- added forward key events functionality. It allows to not eat the key events
by GLWidget, but it forwards them to Qt processing as well.
- destroying GLWidget before GraphicsWindowQt and vice versa does not crash
the application
- it is possible to request particular QGLFormat in GLWidget constructor
- added QtWindowingSystem class
- multithread OSG rendering improvements/fixes

--

From Robert Osfield, added back in getGraphWidget() method for backwards compatibility.

From Rafa Gata, I've been playing around with serializers in order to use it as a "generic" property mechanism for osg::Object.The main problem I have found is that InputStream and OutputStream
only takes the stream when you call start method, and in that case it
attaches to the stream buffer some stuff, useful for files but not for
runtime/gui usage. I have added a simple setInputIterator and
setOutputIterator to the classes so now you can easily serialize
values without version and other stuff.

Writing matrix:
osgDB::OutputStream os(0);
std::stringstream sstream;
os.setOutputIterator(new AsciiOutputIterator(&sstream));
os << matrix;
std::string value = sstream.str();

Reading matrix:
osgDB::InputStream is(0);
std::stringstream sstream(value);
is.setInputIterator(new AsciiInputIterator(&sstream));
osg::Matrixf mat2;
is >> mat2;

From Robert Osfield, added doxygen comments to clarify the role of the methods.

Fixed Coverity reported issue.CID 11447: Unchecked dynamic_cast (FORWARD_NULL)
Dynamic cast to pointer "dynamic_cast <struct osg::NodeCallback *>(nc->clone(this))" can return null.
Assigning null: "first" = "dynamic_cast <struct osg::NodeCallback *>(nc->clone(this))".

The clone() implementation is written using macro's so that it always returns the type of Object
being cloned so it's normally safe to assume that a dynamic_cast<> will always return a valid pointer as long
as the new T that involves creates a valid object.  However, if the class being cloned doesn't correctly
implement the clone() method then their potential for the dynamic_cast to fail and will return a NULL and will
result in a memory leak of the object of paraent class that the clone would have defaulted to.

I've tightened up the CopyOp.cpp code to check the return type and added better handling of the clone in the
osg::clone() methods so thay don't have any potential mememory leaks and report warnings to OSG_WARN when
problems are encountered.  It may be more apporpriate to throw an exception so will need to ponder this
issue further.

From Johannes Baeuerele, "I have extended the pvr reader plugin to support etc1 compression(GL_ETC1_RGB8_OES). The changes attached to this submission are based on today's trunk.The pvr format which can be used as a wrapper for different compressed and uncompressed formats supports this compression algorithm. The original pvr compression uses the pvrtc format. The handling of pvrtc is already implemented in the pvr plugin. PVR provides wrapper functionality for some formats, e.g. etc or even dxt/dds.

Our target system (gles2) is able to use the etc compression format. With minor changes in the submitted files, there is no need to write a separate plugin. However the original pvr texture compression formats are not supported on our target, which is the reason for this extension.

The changes mainly consist in the definition on new enum values in the classes and headers of ReaderWriterPVR,Image and Texture. I also found some locations where the handling of the original pvr textures was not implemented. These are also part of this submission."

From Tomas Hogarth, "Attached are the complete changed files GraphicsWindowIOS and GraphicsWindowIOS.mm. The change is in regard to the ability to adapt to device orientation. We did just have a bool indicating the window would adapt to all orientations. I have changed this to a bit mask allowing the user to specify individual orientations or combinations.                enum DeviceOrientation{

                    PORTRAIT_ORIENTATION = 1<<0,

                    PORTRAIT_UPSIDEDOWN_ORIENTATION  = 1<<1,

                };

                typedef unsigned int DeviceOrientationFlags;

The main motivation for this is to easily allow the user to specifiy that the device is in a horizontal orientation rather then having to rotate the view matrix. All flags have been tested individually as well as in combinations. The default is ALL_ORIENTATIONS to keep the exiting functionality for anyone who hasn't specified WindowData for their context traits.

is loaded but before being passed along to the plugin."

From Paul Martz, "To summarize the fix: OpenGL eye coords are negative outside Cartesian quadrant 1. As a result, the center of projection is eye coord (0,0), which (when used as st tex coords) looks up the lower left corner of the texture. However, in projective texturing, you usually want eye coord (0,0) to look up the center of the texture. Accomplishing this mapping requires not just a lookat and perspective transform, but also a translate and scale."

From Jan Peciva, "please find attached proposed fix for ON_DEMAND rendering. The biggest issue was that the windows did not act on repaint request (WM_PAINT, EXPOSE,...)Detailed explanation:
- I implemented requestRedraw using the push approach (not using
GraphicsWindow::_requestRedraw flag that I was considering) as there may be
multiple viewers reading the flag and fighting to reset it after the paint
request, while some viewers may not spot the request to redraw
- I made windows call GraphicsWindow::requestRedraw when they receive
appropriate message (WM_PAINT, EXPOSE, RESIZE,...)
- There were issues on Linux that windows did not want to close using x
button. Resolved by moving the test for DeleteWindow event from
swapBuffersImplementation() to GraphicsWindowX11::checkEvents(). The difficulty
was that DeleteWindow event is not coming using _eventDisplay, but through
_display.
- The last difficulty was that it is necessary to call
ViewerBase::checkWindowStatus() to set _done to true when all windows are
closed. This did not happened recently in ON_DEMAND run scheme. I put the call
to checkWindowStatus() to eventTraversal.

From Tassilo Glander,"I patched the cmake configuration to support folders, which are really handy to organize the many projects in the OSG solution into examples, applications and core libs in the IDE.

I tested on Visual Studio 2008 with cmake 2.8.3 and 2.8.4.See the screenshots for comparison [img]osg_solution.png[/img]

This needs few changes:

activate on global cmakelist.txt:

[code]set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY USE_FOLDERS On)[/code]

set appropriate folder names for project type in osgMacroUtils.cmake:

[code]SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES(${CORELIB_NAME} PROPERTIES FOLDER "OSG Core")[/code]

From Piotr Gwiazdowski, "Recently I've been having some trouble with osgWidget::StyleManager (I'll omit osgWidget namespace from now on). It seems to me that there are some inconsistency in the code. In Style there are multiple applyStyle method overloads, applying style for different widgets/windows built-in in osgWidget. Plus you can do overrides. It's good so far.The problem lies in StyleManager::_applyStyleToObject (which calls
_coearceAndApply, which calls _applySpecificStyle, which calls
Style::applyStyle). With current implementation Style::applyStyle
variants for Input, Window, Frame::Corner, Frame::Border,
Window::EmbeddedWindow are never called, because their classes' names
are omitted in methods' if/else if block, making it impossible to use
styles with most than half of built-in widget/window types.

My fix simply adds couple else if blocks, making each
Style::applyStyle variant callable. By the way, I think that next
update should add Style::applyStyle overload for Table class and add
proper className overloads for Input and Window."

For example if there were 4 attachments and now only 3, only the first three elements of _bufferAttachmentMap are changed. The fourth is just as before - however it shouldn't be there.Calling _bufferAttachmentMap.clear() before resolves this problem.

With this support, users are able to include additional information in their models.  Additionally, tools such as sketchup that support asset tags use the values appropriately within their imported models."

From Johannes Bauerle, "I experienced problems using binary shaders in osgt files (=the osg-serializer plugins). At runtime std::bad_alloc errors were thrown when using binary shaders.The reason is that the .osgt text files do not provide size information about the contained binary shader hence leading to a bad allocation when reading the shader data, probably size 0 ? The reader method in the responsible serializer class (serializers/osg/BinaryShader) is correct and does not need to be changed as it queries the size as expected. The writer method supports two paths(binary output .osgb and text output .osgt/.osgx). Only the text path is affected as the binary path writes the size.

I extended the writer in the text path by the size information. The results before and after the fix are shown below:

Erroneous code for binary shader in osgt file before fix:

Data {
    0a
    0d
    0
    ...
}

Corrected code for binary shader in osgt file after fix:

Data 524 {
   0a
   0d
   0
   ...
}

After my fix the the thrown error disappeared."

From Jahannes Bauerle, "l discovered that the shader class(/src/osg/Shader.cpp) shows wrong behavior when using binary shaders . When shader objects are compared the reference pointer behind the  _shaderBinary member is not included in the comparison.I included binary shaders into an osgt model file. These shaders only consists of the binary shader code, I did not supply the text version additionally. When loading the model  the osg::Optimizer threw away all shaders except the first one. In the current trunk version of the file two shader objects are identical despite differing _shaderBinary members as the compare method of the Shader class does not include the comparison of that member.

The fix in this submission adds the check for identity of the referenced binary shaders to the shader class.

When comparing two shader objects with text source shaders the new lines of comparison are not even executed as the comparison returns false in the previous lines when the text shaders differ.

With this fix I get expected behavior, the Optimizer handles the different shaders correctly."

From Michael Platings, I've added initial support to osg for glGetProgramBinary and glProgramBinary. This means that shader programs can now be cached to disk and later reloaded, which is much faster than linking shaders from source code. This should mean significantly shorter load times for people who use lots of combinations of shaders.

2. osgDB submission:

we need something that is identify key without modifier keys and layout  -> this is UnmodifedKey

I think osg must have its own UnmodifiedKeys table. Code must be run same on different platforms. This can de guaranteed by UnmodifiedKeys table.

From Sukender, " DAE plugin was linking ORIGINAL images in the Collada file, using image->getName() as a path (even if images were modified in memory!). As the behaviour was not the one of other plugins (3DS, FBX, and such), I made the plugin relativise images filenames (as those plugins) and write the image which is in memory. However, in order to avoid removing features, I kept the previous behaviour but moved it in an option. Here are the options of the plugin I changed: - daeForceTexture was unclear in this new context and removed in favor of two new options - daeLinkOriginalTexturesNoForce: Writes reference to the original image if found, instead of writing the image in memory - daeLinkOriginalTexturesForce: Writes reference to the original image even if not found, instead of writing the image in memory Of course, if you specify no option, images are written as for other plugins.Other thing I changed is the UTF8 support as I told you in a previous conversation. Now there is a simple option, "daeNamesUseCodepage", which makes all names except filenames (materials, animation, geometries...) be considered as encoded using current codepage. If so, they'll be converted to UTF8 when writing; else they are written directly. Of course, filenames follow OSG_USE_UTF8_FILENAME as usual.

From Simon Julier, "I have been using the ply plugin to read files created by bundler and pmvs2 (http://grail.cs.washington.edu/software/pmvs/). This program generates models in the form of vertices only. However, the existing ply reader implementation was not able to handle the models generated in a satisfactory manner for two reasons:1. It did not support normals applied to individual vertices.
2. It would only support red / green / blue colour triples, but the pmvs models are generated with diffuse colours. (The PLY format, http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/dataformats/ply/, lists specular and ambient colour forms as well.)

To partially overcome these limitations, please find attached modified versions of

src/osgPlugins/ply/vertexData.cpp
src/osgPlugins/ply/vertexData.h

The changes I've made are:

1. I have changed the boolean hasColor flag to a vertexField (which is a boolean operation on an enum) to indicate what fields are present in the ply file. (This is required because Turk's ply reader spits out warnings for every line where you try to read fields which do not exist.)
2. I have modified the code to apply valid normals to either triangles or vertices.
3. I have kludged in "support" for the various colour variants. Specifically, all the colour specified can be read from the file. However, they are all applied in the same way (namely as a colour array, bound to each vertex)."

you would expect that "Group" would be output. However, as there are many overloaded operator<< functions, none of which take a const char* argument, the function that's actually called is operator<<(bool). Hence what actually gets output is "TRUE".
An actual example of this is in serializers\osgAnimation\Animation.cpp, WRITE_CHANNEL_FUNC2.

So the simple solution to this is to add operator<<(const char*), attached.

rather than pushing a NodePath containing the Terrain onto NodeVisitor.  This
change means that the DatabasePager nolonger needs to observer the whole NodePath and
will be lighter and quicker for it.

The change also means that ReadFileCallback can now run custom NodeVisitor's on the scene graph without
having to worry about TerrainTile's constructing scene graphs prior to the Terrain being assigned.

Also changed is the NodeVisitor::DatabaseRequestHandler which now requires a NodePath to the node that you wish
to add to rather than just the pointer to the node you wish to add to.  This is more robust when handling scenes
with multiple parental paths, whereas previously errors could have occurred due to the default of picking the first
available parental path.  This change means that subclasses of DatabasePager will need to be updated to use this new
function entry point.

From Glenn Waldron, "Attached is a fix to State::convertVertexShaderSourceToOsgBuiltIns. The method was incorrectly inserting new declarations before a GLSL "#version" directive, which must always be the first line in a shader. This patch detects the #version directive and ensures that new declarations are inserted after it.Attached is the modified State.cpp file.

I have also attached a sample transcript, showing the new code working properly. I ran it against osgEarth's shaders and it works as expected.

I saw a very noticeable performance problem (60 fps -> 8 fps) in DrawThreadPerContext mode in an osgEarth application before this patch. I had high hopes that this change might fix the much-discussed multiple GPU problem; no such luck, but I think the root cause of that is probably a similar threading issue."

The user can specify the type of package generator (i.e. rpms. deb, NSIS, tar, zip, etc) that they would like to use from the CPack supported packages/installation methods.

I also changed the CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME to use OSG_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME which contains the name of each component so all of the component packages can be generated without renaming the files.

This should make it even easier to create distribution packages for the various linux, windows and mac distribution methods supported by CPack."

You may select to output every tile as an image file, or combine them together to create a large poster, for example, a 12800 x 9600 image.

Start the program like this:

./osgposter --output-poster --poster output.bmp --tilesize 800 600 --finalsize 8000 6000 cow.osg

Adjust the scene camera to a suitable position and press 'p' or 'P' on the keyboard. Wait until sub-cameras dispatching is finished. And the poster file will be created while closing window. A 8000 x 6000 output.bmp will be created to show a fine-printed cow. :)

Hope this will bring more ideas to those who face similar problems, especially simulation game designers. :)I didn't map all DirectInput key values to GUIEventAdapter key
symbols. Users may add more in the buildKeyMap() function freely. The
mouse handling operations are also ignored, but will be easily
improved in the same way of creating keyboard and joystick devices.

Please add a line:

FIND_PACKAGE(DirectInput)

From Tim Moore, "Here is initial support for uniform buffer objects. The binding between a buffer object and an indexed target is implemented as a new StateAttribute, UniformBufferBinding. I've included an example program based on the code in the ARB_uniform_buffer_object specification.A few things remain to do:
* The binding between a uniform block in a shader program and a buffer indexed target number is fixed, like a vertex attribute binding. This is too restrictive because that binding can be changed without relinking the program. This mapping should be done by name in the same way that uniform values are handled i.e., like a pseudo state attribute;

* There's no direct way yet to query for the offset of uniforms in uniform block, so only the std140 layout is really usable. A helper class that implemented the std140 rules would be quite helpful for setting up uniform blocks without having to link a program first;

* There's no direct support for querying parameters such as the maximum block length, minimum offset alignment, etc. Having that information available outside of the draw thread would make certain instancing techniques easier to implement."

From Tomas Holgarth and Stephan Huber, " attached you'll find the second part of the IOS-submission. It contains* GraphicsWindowIOS, which supports external and "retina" displays,
 multisample-buffers (for IOS > 4.0) and multi-touch-events
* an ios-specific implementation of the imageio-plugin
* an iphone-viewer example
* cMake support for creating a xcode-project
* an updated ReadMe-file describing the necessary steps to get a
 working xcode-project-file from CMake

Please credit Thomas Hogarth and Stephan Huber for these changes.

This brings the ios-support in line with the git-fork on github. It
needs some more testing and some more love, the cmake-process is still a
little complicated.

You'll need a special version of the freetype lib compiled for IOS,
there's one bundled in the OpenFrameworks-distribution, which can be used."

Notes, from Robert Osfield, modified CMakeLists.txt files so that the IOS specific paths are within IF(APPLE) blocks.

Problem 2 :

Projection is orthogonal so "shadow2D" build-in function is sufficient.

Problem 3:
Bad calcul in
osgShadow::ParallelSplitShadowMap::calculateLightViewProjectionFormFrustum(..)
provide some visual error in specific configuration.


to reproduce pssm_bug.jpg, you need to add a light direction in osgshadow.cpp example (done in joint osgshadow.cpp file)
then "osgshadow --noUpdate --pssm --maxFarDist 500 --minNearSplit 500 --mapcount 6 --debug-color  model_test.3ds"


As you can see in pssm_bug.jpg and pssm_fix.jpg, performance is really better when Problem 1 is fixed.

From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a proposal for handling multi-touch-events with osgGA. My approach is to bundle all touchpoints into one custom data structure which is attached to an GUIEventAdapter.The current approach simulates a moving mouse for the first touch-point,
so basic manipulators do work, sort of.

I created a MultiTouchTrackballManipulator-class, one touch-point does
rotate the view, two touch-points pan and zoom the view as known from
the iphone or other similar multi-touch-devices. A double-tap (similar
to a double-click) resets the manipulator to its home-position.

The multi-touch-trackball-implementation is not the best, see it as a
first starting point. (there's a demo-video at http://vimeo.com/15017377 )"

From Wang Rui, "I've finally completed the static build support for dotosg wrapper and serialization libraries. My submission mainly includes: 1. Add two new macros USE_DOTOSGWRAPPER_LIBRARY and USE_SERIALIZER_WRAPPER_LIBRARY. Applications using static OSG must include corresponding static-link libraries and use these two macros to predefine native format wrappers. Please see osgstaticviewer and present3D in the attachment for details.2. Add a LibraryWrapper.cpp file in each
osgWrappers/deprecated-dotosg/... and osgWrappers/serializers/...
subfolder, which calls all USE_...WRAPPERS macros inside. The
LibraryWrapper file is automatically generated by the
wrapper_includer.cpp (with some slight fixes), which is also attached
for your reference. The deprecated-dotosg/osgAnimation is not included
because it doesn't us REGISTER_DOTOSGWRAPPER to define its wrappers.

3. Modify the ReaderWriterOSG.cpp to prevent calling loadWrappers()
when static build.

4. An uncorrelated fix to Serializer and ObjectWrapper.cpp, which
ensures version variables of serialziers are initialized, and
serializers out-of-version are not written to model files.

I attached an updated version of the file implementing this."

From Tim More and Robert Osfield, implementation of ARB_timer_query based GPU timing stats syncronization.Initial email from Tim : "I've implemented using a timestamp, available with ARB_timer_query and OpenGL 3.3, to gather GPU stats. This is nice because it can accurately fix the GPU draw time with respect to the other times on the stats graph, rather than having to estimate the wall time of the end of GPU drawing. This also prevents anomalies like the GPU phase starting before the draw phase..."
Changes to Tim's submission by Robert:  Removal of need for swap buffer callback in ViewerBase.cpp, by
integrating a osg::State::frameCompleted() method that does the stats timing collection.  Introduction of a
GraphicsContext::swapBuffersCallbackOrImplementation() method that calls the State::frameCompleted() and
the swap buffers callback or the swapImplementation as required.

From Wang Rui, "I'm now testing static building of OSG and found a possible bug in the present3D application. As static-link present3d should depend on freetype, png, pdf and some other plugins, any mis-compiling of these plugins will make present3d fail to be built. Some lirbaries like poppler and cairo are not popular under Windows, so it is very common that we don't have osgdb_pdf compiled and thus get errors when building present3d. I've modified the CMakeLists and present3d.cpp to avoid this problem."

However I think the fix isn't correct because it checks the MSVC version instead of the CMake version.

Refactored the versioning of serializers so it now uses a _firstVersion and _lastVersion make it possible to specify what range of versions support each serializer.

Tue, 9 Nov 2010 12:41:55 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Wang Rui, "I'd like to submit my latest modification of the serialization IO functionalities. It includes two main parts: a version checking macro for handling backward-compatiblity since 3.0, and enhencement of current schema mechanism. I also change the option handling process to use getPluginStringData(), and add new USE_SERIALIZER_WRAPPER macro in the Registry header to allow for static-link usage as well.The enhencement of schema machanism just tells the type of each
serializer while outputting them, such as:
osg::Group = Children:1

The meaning of the number can be found in the osgDB/Serializer header,
BaseSerializer::Type enum. It may help 3rdparty utilities understand
the structure of the wrapper and do some reflection work in the
future.

The new macro UPDATE_TO_VERSION can help indicate the InputStream (no
affect on the writer) that a serializer is added/removed since certain
OSG version. An example wrapper file is also attached. The
Geode_modified.cpp is based on the serializers/osg/Geode.cpp file
(hey, don't merge it :-), but assumes that a new user serializer
'Test' is added since version 65 (that is, the OSG_SOVERSION):

REGISTER_OBJECT_WRAPPER( Geode, ... )
{
   ADD_USER_SERIALIZER( Drawables );  // origin ones

   UPDATE_TO_VERSION( 65 )
   {
       ADD_USER_SERIALIZER( Test );  // a serializer added from version 65
   }
}

All kinds of ADD_... macros following UPDATE_TO_VERSION will
automatically apply the updated version. The braces here are only for
typesetting!
While reading an osgt/osgb/osgx file, OSG will now check if the file
version (recorded as the writer's soversion, instead of previous
meaningless "#Version 2") is equal or greater than Test's version, and
try reading it, or just ignore it if file version is lesser.

And we also have the REMOVE_SERIALIZER macro will mark a named
serializer as removed in some version, with which all files generated
by further versions will just ignore it:

UPDATE_TO_VERSION( 70 )
{
   REMOVE_SERIALIZER( Test );
}

This means that from version 70, the serializer Test is removed (but
not actually erased from the list) and should not be read anymore. If
the read file version is less than 70 (and equal or greater than 65),
Test will still be handled when reading; otherwise it will be ignored
to keep compatiblity on different OSG versions.

From Johan Nouvel, "Some times ago, I have coded an osg to vrml2 writer. Today, I have updated our writer to osg 2.9.9. As it works (for our needs at least) I've done and attached a tar.gz file for the VRML2 plugin with a new part to write a VRML2 file from an osg one.The read part is the same as in osg 2.9.9.

The write part code is in convertToVRML.cpp and .h  files. It works for some osg nodes (group, geode, matrixTransform, positionAttitudeTransform and geometry). Textures are converted to jpeg (if not translucent) or png (if translucent).
There are some options that could be given to the writer (with -O switch) :

convertTextures=0   to copy textures without converting them to jpeg or png
convertTextures=-1  do not copy textures, keep them in their original format and location
convertTextures=-2  do not use textures, parse only geometry
convertTextures=-3 (default) convert textures to jpeg or png ones.

textureUnit=X  in case of multiple textures, X= texture unit to use (default value=0)

directoryTexture=aPath  when texture will be copied, it will be in this directory, not in the current one."

From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "As promised, here is the fix for the background size. I also added another instance variable _lineHeight to clean up the code a bit more.Also I've done the osguserstats example. I've kept the "toy example" that was in the modified osgviewer.cpp I had sent you, because they show different uses of custom stats lines (a value displayed directly, a value without bars and a value with bars and graph). I also added a function and a thread that will sleep for a given number of milliseconds and record this time in the stats. I think it clearly shows how to record the time some processing takes and add that to the stats graph, whether the processing takes place on the same thread as the viewer or on another thread.

BTW, feel free to modify the colors I've given to each user stats line... I'm not very artistic. :-)

I've also added more doc comments to the addUserStats() method in ViewerEventHandlers, so hopefully the arguments are clear and the way to get the results you want is also clear. Maybe I went overboard, but the function makes some assumptions that may not be obvious and has many arguments, so I preferred to be explicit."

From Wang Rui, "additional FFmpegParameters class in the ffmpeg plugin for setting parameters before opening the video file, which benefits from getPluginStringData() as shown in the ReaderWriter implementation.Now we can use ffmpeg to render webcam video (using the vfwcap device) under Windows:

osgmovie 0 -e ffmpeg -O "format=vfwcap frame_rate=25"

The number 0 just indicates a default device number in ffmpeg.

I think this can work under Linux, too, and should be a bit better than comparing the filename with a '/dev/' string. Just type:

./osgmovie /dev/yourcam -e ffmpeg -O "format=video4linux2 frame_rate=30 size=320x240""

From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "For a long time now I've wanted to be able to add custom values into the stats handler's graph. Here is my proposal of how I'd do this. It's surely not perfect and I'm open to suggestions, but I've already made more changes than I wanted to in order to be able to implement this...The user calls statsHandler->addUserStatsLine() providing:

- the label they want for that line in the graph
- the text and bar colors they want in the graph
- the stats names they want queried (one for time taken, one for begin and one for end time) and a few settings for how these will be displayed.

Then all they have to do is call viewer->getViewerStats()->setAttribute(framenumber, name, value) for their three attributes each frame and they'll have their stats in the graph.

They can also give only a time taken attribute (or some other numerical value they want printed, which can be averaged or not), or only begin+end attributes, and the graph will accordingly display only the (average or not) numerical value or only the bars.

Along the way I cleaned up the existing code a bit:

* Each time the setUpScene() or createCameraTimeStats() methods added a line to the graph, they did pretty much the same thing, so I moved that into a separate method called createTimeStatsLine() which is called by setUpScene() and createCameraTimeStats().

* I moved the font, characterSize, startBlocks and leftPos variables to member variables, since they were being passed around everywhere but were set only once at the beginning.

* The geode on which stats lines are added is also kept in a member variable, and createCameraTimeStats() adds the per-camera lines to this geode instead of returning a new Group with a new Geode. This further reduces the number of variables the createCameraTimeStats() method needs as input.

From Jan Peciva, "attaching Matrix_implementation fix for two problems:- using m.getPerspective( fovy, tmp, tmp, tmp ) to get only FOV does not work.
The reason is that getPerspective is taking tmp as reference - thus all the three variables points to the same memory location. Then, zNear (third parameter) is used inside the method, while zNear content was spoiled by zFar that was written to the same place, resulting in fovy set to nan. I consider that it is the right of programmers to use 3 times tmp as parameter and I fixed the code in the method. I have done the same for getFrustum and getLookAt.

- I fixed makeFrustum to accept infinite zFar. (Some graphics techniques like shadow volumes require placing zFar to infinity to avoid visual artifacts.)"

Note from Robert Osfield, change the local near & far variable names to temp_near and temp_far MS Visual Studio has a record of using near and far names.

Improved the handling of matrices in serialization so that it's more reliable, change was to use doubles for reading and writing matrices regardless of type of Matrix being serialized.Change does break backwards compatibility though, so code
path supporting original format has been left in for the

is over complicated compared to the simplified handling.   Once
the new code has been bedded down for a while I'll remove this code block.

From Wojciech Lewandowski, "As promised I prepared a patch to expose WGL_SWAP_METHOD / PFD_SWAP_METHOD  selection via GraphicsContext::Traits. Since Traits don't define any enums (I guess to be simple to use) I tried to keep it that way and have added two boolean values: swapCopy & swapExchange. It is somewhat similar approach to GDI PixelFormatDescription were both options can be present together.  Feel free to replace it with enum if you find it more appropriate.I also uderstand that there is a need to select system wide default  method and have also modified DisplaySettings to contain swapMethod parameter. Swap method in Traits uses value set in DisplaySettings as default. Proper environment and command line args were added.  Its possible to define default DeisplaySettings swap method in standard way via system flags or with comand line.

Env Vars:
    OSG_SWAP_METHOD  = DEFAULT | COPY | EXCHANGE
or Command Line:
    --swap-method   DEFAULT | COPY | EXCHANGE

I also added handling of WM_ERASEBKGND in GraphicsWindowWin32. It may be unneccessary but code should be safer this way than without handling it.  I have placed a comment explaining the reason above the change.

Changes were made against today trunk.

PS. I tested only Windows code. I briefly checked X11 & Cocoa files but have not noticed SwapMethod to be used there.

From March Sciabica, "Here is the solution I coded up over the weekend. For improved performance option, I added a flag to control whether the depth writing pass is performed.Since text is alpha-blended when rendering, it is placed in the
transparent bin and rendered back to front. Writing to the depth buffer
should therefore be unnecessary. Indeed, rendering something behind text
(or any blended object) after that object is drawn will give incorrect
results whether the depth buffer is written or not. I therefore think it
is safe to keep this option off by default. Users can turn it on for any
special needs they have.

I did not fix the existing backdrop implementations to work with the new
code since this new method of rendering intrinsically handles backdrops
correctly. Its results are more accurate than all of the existing
backdrop implementations. Its only downside is that it requires two
passes if depth buffer updates are desired, whereas DEPTH_RANGE and
POLYGON_OFFSET achieve their (less accurate) results in one pass. The
NO_DEPTH_BUFFER method also only uses one pass, but it disables depth
tests and not depth writes so will have serious problems if anything is
drawn in front of the text before OR after the text is drawn.

Given the better all-around behavior of the new method, I believe the
other backdrop implementations can be safely removed. Code that adjusts
the backdrop implementation will of course be broken if the member
functions are removed. For this reason I left them in, but set the new
rendering method as the default backdrop implementation. At the very
least I think the old backdrop implementations should be deprecated and
removed at a later date.
"

Note from Robert Osfield, testing this submission with osgtext I found that the
text would not render correctly when different text labels were overlapping
in deth and screen space.  I change _enableDepthWrites to default to true and
found the that which artifacts still occurred around the alpha blended edges
the artifacts where better than issue with occlusion of nearer pixels that was
happening with _enableDepthWrites set to false.I therefore set the
_enableDepthWrites to true as I feel it's the lesser of the two artefacts.

From Mathias Fielder, "i found an issue with the serializer writing shared arrays. At OutputStream::writeArray(), if the currently latest array is shared the full array content will be written. The following code snippet will reproduce this issue:Code:

osg::Vec2 vec(0.f, 0.f);
osg::Array* sharedArray = new osg::Vec2Array(1, & vec);

// create 2 geometries sharing same array
osg::Geometry* geom0 = new osg::Geometry;
osg::Geometry* geom1 = new osg::Geometry;
geom0->setVertexArray(sharedArray);
geom1->setVertexArray(sharedArray);

osg::ref_ptr<osg::Geode> geode = new osg::Geode;
geode->addDrawable(geom0);
geode->addDrawable(geom1);

std::stringstream buffer;

// write node
osg::ref_ptr<osgDB::Options> options = new osgDB::Options("Ascii");
osgDB::ReaderWriter* rw = osgDB::Registry::instance()->getReaderWriterForExtension("osgt");
osgDB::ReaderWriter::WriteResult wr = rw->writeNode(*geode, buffer, options.get());

// print result; array will be written twice with full content, though with same ID
std::cout << buffer.str() << std::endl;

// trying to read back node will print warnings about unmatched properties
osgDB::ReaderWriter::ReadResult rr = rw->readNode(buffer, options.get());




To fix this i made a change in OutputStream::writeArray().
I think the same issue applies to OutputStream::writeObject(). So i made the same change there.

From Jan Peciva, "please, find attached improved Stencil and StencilTwoSided classes.Goals:
- to handle INCR_WRAP values nicely if not supported by OpenGL (old hardware)
- to support two side stenciling of OpenGL 2.0. Current implementation does not work on ATI as it uses Nvidia extension.

Ready for commit:
- Stencil and Stencil.cpp - please, review them

Ready with "hack":
- StencilTwoSided.cpp: please, see the line 113 in apply():

      glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST_TWO_SIDE);

This line used to be in getModeUsage() as

      usage.usesMode(GL_STENCIL_TEST_TWO_SIDE);

Problems with my "glEnable" solution:
- it enables two side stenciling forever, and it will disturb any other single-side stenciling in the scene graph.

Form Wang Rui, "An initial GLSL shader support of rendering particles. Only the POINT type is supported at present. The attached osgparticleshader.cpp will show how it works. It can also be placed in the examples folder. But I just wonder how this example co-exists with another two (osgparticle and osgparticleeffect)?Member variables in Particle, including _alive, _current_size and
_current_alpha, are now merged into one Vec3 variable. Then we can
make use of the set...Pointer() methods to treat them as vertex
attribtues in GLSL. User interfaces are not changed.

Additional methods of ParticleSystem are introduced, including
setDefaultAttributesUsingShaders(), setSortMode() and
setVisibilityDistance(). You can see how they work in
osgparticleshader.cpp.

Additional user-defined particle type is introduced. Set the particle
type to USER and attach a drawable to the template. Be careful because
of possible huge memory consumption. It is highly suggested to use
display lists here.

The ParticleSystemUpdater can accepts ParticleSystem objects as child
drawables now. I myself think it is a little simpler in structure,
than creating a new geode for each particle system. Of course, the
latter is still compatible, and can be used to transform entire
particles in the world.

New particle operators: bounce, sink, damping, orbit and explosion.
The bounce and sink opeartors both use a concept of domains, and can
simulate a very basic collision of particles and objects.

New composite placer. It contains a set of placers and emit particles
from them randomly. The added virtual method size() of each placer
will help determine the probability of generating.

New virtual method operateParticles() for the Operator class. It
actually calls operate() for each particle, but can be overrode to use
speedup techniques like SSE, or even shaders in the future.

Partly fix a floating error of 'delta time' in emitter, program and
updaters. Previously they keep the _t0 variable seperately and compute
different copies of dt by themseleves, which makes some operators,
especially the BounceOperator, work incorrectly (because the dt in
operators and updaters are slightly different). Now a getDeltaTime()
method is maintained in ParticleSystem, and will return the unique dt
value (passing by reference) for use. This makes thing better, but
still very few unexpected behavours at present...

All dotosg and serialzier wrappers for functionalities above are provided.

...

According to some simple tests, the new shader support is slightly
efficient than ordinary glBegin()/end(). That means, I haven't got a
big improvement at present. I think the bottlenack here seems to be
the cull traversal time. Because operators go through the particle
list again and again (for example, the fountain in the shader example
requires 4 operators working all the time).

A really ideal solution here is to implement the particle operators in
shaders, too, and copy the results back to particle attributes. The
concept of GPGPU is good for implementing this. But in my opinion, the
Camera class seems to be too heavy for realizing such functionality in
a particle system. Myabe a light-weight ComputeDrawable class is
enough for receiving data as textures and outputting the results to
the FBO render buffer. What do you think then?

The floating error of emitters
(http://lists.openscenegraph.org/pipermail/osg-users-openscenegraph.org/2009-May/028435.html)
is not solved this time. But what I think is worth testing is that we
could directly compute the node path from the emitter to the particle
system rather than multiplying the worldToLocal and LocalToWorld
matrices. I'll try this idea later.

From Ulrich Hertlein, "not sure how severe this is but I believe there's a bug in Texture.cpp:applyTexImage2D_subload:<code>
unsigned char* data = = (unsigned char*)image->data();
if (needImageRescale) {
 // allocates rescale buffer
 data = new unsigned char[newTotalSize];

 // calls gluScaleImage into the data buffer
}

const unsigned char* dataPtr = image->data();
// subloads 'dataPtr'

// deletes 'data'
</code>

In effect, the scaled data would never be used.

I've also replaced bits of duplicate code in Texture1D/2D/2DArray/3D/Cubemap/Rectangle
that checks if the texture image can/should be unref'd with common functionality in
Texture.cpp.

From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "osgWidget::WindowManager did nothing in its keyUp event, and in particular didn't call any callbacks. Since I wanted to have callbacks on keyUp, I copied what it does on keyDown, which works for me. I could have just used keyDown and saved myself the trouble, but you know me... :-)osgWidget::Input:

[Functional changes]
- Previously, the field would be filled with spaces up to its max length, and typing would just replace the spaces. Also, there was a _textLength variable that kept track of the real length of text in the field, since the osgText::Text's length just reflected the length of spaces+text entered. This was not great, as you could still select the spaces with the mouse and it just feels hacky. So I changed it to only contain the text entered, no spaces, and _textLength was removed since it's now redundant (the osgText::Text's length is used instead).
- Fixed the selection size which (visually only) showed one more character selected than what was really selected.
- Fixed selection by dragging the mouse, it would sometimes not select the last character of the string.
- Cursor will now accurately reflect whether insert mode is activated (block cursor) or we're in normal mode (line cursor) like in most editors.
- Implemented Ctrl-X (cut)
- Added a new clear() method that allows the field to be emptied correctly. Useful for a command line interface, for example (hint, hint).
- Mouse and keyboard event handler methods would always return false, which meant selecting with the mouse would also rotate the trackball, and typing an 's' would turn on stats.

[Code cleanup]
- Renamed the (local) _selectionMin and _selectionMax variables which are used in a lot of places, as the underscores would lead to think they were members. Either I called them selection{Min|Max} or delete{Min|Max} where it made more sense.
- Fixed some indenting which was at 3 spaces (inconsistently), I'm sure I didn't catch all the lines where this was the case though.
- Put spaces between variable, operator and value where missing, especially in for()s. Again I only did this where I made changes, there are probably others left.

The result is that delete, backspace, Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, and typing behaviour should now be consistent with text editor conventions, whether insert mode is enabled or not. I hope. :-)

Note, there's a nasty const_cast in there. Why isn't osgText::Font::getGlyph() declared const?

Also, as a note, the current implementation of cut, copy and paste (in addition to being Windows only, yuck) gets and puts the data into an std::string, thus if the osgText::String in the field contains unicode characters I think it won't work correctly. Perhaps someone could implement a proper clipboard class that would be cross-platform and support osgText::String (more precisely other languages like Chinese) correctly? Cut, copy and paste are not critical to what I'm doing so I won't invest the time to do that, but I just thought I'd mention it.

From Tassilo Glander, "I want to submit a fix for the plugin to load .x model files (Direct X).The current version crashes when encountering global materials, as also reported in the forum by the author of the plugin.

The problem in mesh.cpp (app. ln 247) is, that references to global materials that are given in curly brackets {} are not supported by the reader. However, curly brackets seem to be common, according to Bourke. Unfortunately, I found no specification. However, also the DirectX model viewer that comes with the DirectX-SDK (August 2009) expects curly brackets and refuses models without them.

My fix checks 2 more cases ("{ aMaterial }" -> 3 tokens and "{aMaterial}" -> 1 token), and extracts the material name for the lookup. I don't know if this is the most elegant solution, but the tokenizer seems to split based on white spaces.

You can reproduce the bug with the attached model (box.x), which loads fine in other tools, such as 3DSmax, DeepExploration or the DirectX model viewer. When I remove the curly brackets at the reference of "myGlobalMaterial", it loads in osgviewer, but is not standard conform.

From Nathan Monteleone and Robert Osfield,submission email from Nathan: "I discovered a problem with POINT_ROT_EYE billboards in IntersectionVisitor: because we pass in just the model matrix to Billboard::computeBillboardMatrix, the billboard gets the wrong up vector.  It really needs to take the view matrix into account to get the correct up vector.

This version of IntersectionVisitor.cpp is made against today's SVN.  It corrects the problem by computing the billboard matrix using the complete modelview, and then multiplies by the inverse of the view matrix before pushing onto IntersectionVisitor's model stack.  The only code I changed is in apply(Billboard&)."

From David Fries, merge from a series of related submission emails:"enable thread locking in libavcodec

This is required for a multithreaded application using ffmpeg from
another thread."

"Prevent the audio from videos from hanging on exit if they are paused.
The video decoder already has similar logic."

"Add a way to retrieve the creation time for MPEG-4 files."

"fmpeg, improve wait for close logic

Both audio and video destructors have been succesfully using the logic,
if(isRunning())
{
  m_exit = true;
  join();
}
since it was introduced,

but the close routines are using,
m_exit = true;
if(isRunning() && waitForThreadToExit)
{
  while(isRunning()) { OpenThreads::Thread::YieldCurrentThread(); }
}
which not only is it doing an unnecessary busy wait, but it doesn't
guaranteed that the other thread has terminated, just that it has
progressed far enough that OpenThreads has set the thread status as
not running.  Like the destructor set the m_exit after checking
isRunning() to avoid the race condition of not getting to join()
because the thread was running, but isRunning() returns false.

Now that FFmpeg*close is fixed, call it from the destructor as well
to have that code in only one location."

It's kind of annoying since there is nothing actually wrong. The message is generated from TextureRectangle::applyTexImage_subload when it fails to create a pbo, even if the Image object is not even requesting to use a pbo. This message is not generated by all the other code in TextureRectangle.cpp & Texture.cpp that also attempts to create pbo's.

From Ryan Kawicki, "I found a memory leak within the Terrex plugin.Out application has the ability to switch to different types of terrains on the fly.  This problem only exists in this type of situation.

The TXPArchive is held by the ReadWriterTXP class.  When the TXPNode, which is the top level node, is released from memory, the archive associated to that TXPNode is also released.  The issue is that the reference count on the TXPArchive never gets to zero.

The reason why the reference count never gets to zero is because the TXPParse, which is owned by the TXPArchive, stores a ref_ptr to the TXPArchive.  You can then see why this becomes a problem.  The TXPParser's ref_ptr cannot be unreferenced since the TXPArchive has not released the TXPParser.

Since the TXPParser is fully contained within the TXPArchive, I don't see the reason to have the TXPParser have a ref_ptr to the TXPArchive.  I've made this change locally and have had no problems and our memory leak has been fixed.

From Mathias Froehlich, "I have now put together what I have for the order independent transparency or short oit. This rendering technique is also known as depth peeling.Attached is the example that makes depth peeling work with the fixed function
pipeline. Ok, this is 'old fashioned' but required for our use case that
still has to work on older UNIX OpenGL implementations as well as together
with a whole existing application making use of the fixed function pipeline.
I can imagine to add support for shaders when we have that shader composition
framework where we can add a second depth test in a generic way.

This does *not* implement the dual depth peeling described in a paper from the
ETH Zurich.

This example could serve as a test case for the feature that you can on the
fly remove pre render cameras that you made work a few time ago.
It is also a test case for the new TraversalOrderBin that is used to composite
the depth layers in the correct blend order.
This example also stresses your new texture object cache since you can change
some parameters for the oit implementation at runtime.

You can just load any model with osgoit and see how it works.
Use the usual help key to see what you can change.

There is already an osgdepthpeeling example that I could not really make sense
of up to now. So I just made something new without touching what I do not
understand."

From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "I've been working in the last few days to get QWidgetImage to a point where it can fill a need we have: to be able to use Qt to make HUDs and to display widgets over / inside an OSG scene.---------------
Current results
---------------
I've attached what I have at this point. The modified QWidgetImage +
QGraphicsViewAdapter classes can be rendered fullscreen (i.e. the Qt
QGraphicsView's size follows the size of the OSG window) or on a quad in
the scene as before. It will let events go through to OSG if no widget
is under the mouse when they happen (useful when used as a HUD with
transparent parts - a click-focus scheme could be added later too). It
also supercedes Martin Scheffler's submission because it adds a
getter/setter for the QGraphicsViewAdapter's background color (and the
user can set their widget to be transparent using
widget->setAttribute(Qt::WA_TranslucentBackground) themselves).

The included osgQtBrowser example has been modified to serve as a test
bed for these changes. It has lots more command line arguments than
before, some of which can be removed eventually (once things are
tested). Note that it may be interesting to change its name or split it
into two examples. Though if things go well, the specific QWebViewImage
class can be removed completely and we can consolidate to using
QWidgetImage everywhere, and then a single example to demonstrate it
would make more sense, albeit not named osgQtBrowser... You can try this
path by using the --useWidgetImage --useBrowser command line arguments -
this results in an equivalent setup to QWebViewImage, but using
QWidgetImage, and doesn't work completely yet for some unknown reason,
see below.

----------------
Remaining issues
----------------
There are a few issues left to fix, and for these I request the
community's assistance. They are not blockers for me, and with my
limited Qt experience I don't feel like I'm getting any closer to fixing
them, so if someone else could pitch in and see what they can find, it
would be appreciated. It would be really nice to get them fixed, that
way we'd really have a first-class integration of Qt widgets in an OSG
scene. The issues are noted in the osgQtBrowser.cpp source file, but
here they are too:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
  QWidgetImage still has some issues, some examples are:

  1. Editing in the QTextEdit doesn't work. Also when started with
     --useBrowser, editing in the search field on YouTube doesn't
     work. But that same search field when using QWebViewImage
     works... And editing in the text field in the pop-up getInteger
     dialog works too. All these cases use QGraphicsViewAdapter
     under the hood, so why do some work and others don't?

     a) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage [--fullscreen] (optional)
     b) Try to click in the QTextEdit and type, or to select text
        and drag-and-drop it somewhere else in the QTextEdit. These
        don't work.
     c) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --sanityCheck
     d) Try the operations in b), they all work.
     e) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --useBrowser [--fullscreen]
     f) Try to click in the search field and type, it doesn't work.
     g) osgQtBrowser
     h) Try the operation in f), it works.

  2. Operations on floating windows (--numFloatingWindows 1 or more).
     Moving by dragging the titlebar, clicking the close button,
     resizing them, none of these work. I wonder if it's because the
     OS manages those functions (they're functions of the window
     decorations) so we need to do something special for that? But
     in --sanityCheck mode they work.

     a) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --numFloatingWindows 1
                     [--fullscreen]
     b) Try to drag the floating window, click the close button, or
        drag its sides to resize it. None of these work.
     c) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --numFloatingWindows 1
                     --sanityCheck
     d) Try the operations in b), all they work.
     e) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage [--fullscreen]
     f) Click the button so that the getInteger() dialog is
        displayed, then try to move that dialog or close it with the
        close button, these don't work.
     g) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --sanityCheck
     h) Try the operation in f), it works.

  3. (Minor) The QGraphicsView's scrollbars don't appear when
     using QWidgetImage or QWebViewImage. QGraphicsView is a
     QAbstractScrollArea and it should display scrollbars as soon as
     the scene is too large to fit the view.

     a) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --fullscreen
     b) Resize the OSG window so it's smaller than the QTextEdit.
        Scrollbars should appear but don't.
     c) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --sanityCheck
     d) Try the operation in b), scrollbars appear. Even if you have
        floating windows (by clicking the button or by adding
        --numFloatingWindows 1) and move them outside the view,
        scrollbars appear too. You can't test that case in OSG for
        now because of problem 2 above, but that's pretty cool.

  4. (Minor) In sanity check mode, the widget added to the
     QGraphicsView is centered. With QGraphicsViewAdapter, it is not.

     a) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage [--fullscreen]
     b) The QTextEdit and button are not in the center of the image
        generated by the QGraphicsViewAdapter.
     c) osgQtBrowser --useWidgetImage --sanityCheck
     d) The QTextEdit and button are in the center of the
        QGraphicsView.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see I've put specific repro steps there too, so it's clear
what I mean by a given problem. The --sanityCheck mode is useful to see
what should happen in a "normal" Qt app that demonstrates the same
situation, so hopefully we can get to a point where it behaves the same
with --sanityCheck and without."

From Cedric Pinson, "Here a fix about a leak in InputStream::decompressI changed
       _in->setStream( new std::stringstream(data) );
to
       _dataDecompress = new std::stringstream(data);
       _in->setStream( _dataDecompress );

Then when the destructor is of InputStream is called I delete the
dataDecompress stringstream.

From Michael Platings, "Hi Bob, thanks for the CMake fixes. I'm not sure what the purpose of the capitalisation changes was so I've reverted that (a) to make diff-ing easier and (b) because all-caps is consistent with all the other OSG CMake files. Aside from that the changes seem fine. I don't understand the changes to ReaderWriterFBX.cpp - (i) strings.h isn't a standard header, (ii) the ISO-conformant form is _strnicmp (with the underscore). Does the existing code not compile for you? If not we'll have to do some #ifdef nastiness."

An app must call gw->useCursor(false) after having created the context as a workaround, but I think what we ask for in the traits should be honored... Attached is a simple fix for this.I have no idea when this stopped working. It worked before in our 2.6.0-based apps but after the upgrade to 2.8.3 it doesn't anymore.

From Wang Rui, "For a long time, the osgviewerMFC example uses addSlave() to setup the graphics context and link it with a slave camera. I don't know the reason we perform like that, which will cause a problem that the GUIEventHandler may not obtain correct window coordinates because the main camera will use a default input range to receive events from the slave camera's graphics context. It is also weird to see the addSlave() used in non-cluster applications, which beginners will be confused with.I've make a slightly modification to the osgviewerMFC example to make
it work without setting slave cameras. I've tested with the MDI
framework and everything seems fine."

From Michael Platings, The attached file fixes 2 issues: 1) some time values were passed as floats, reducing accuracy. 2) comparisons done between doubles and floats gave different results so time < endtime evaluated to false the first time it was checked (with doubles), and true the second time it was checked (with time having been converted to a float). This consequently resulted in an array-out-of-bounds crash

A problem with transparency has also been fixed: objects were transparent wrt themselves but were opaque wrt to other objects. Finally I added the support for "mixing factors" of diffuse, reflective and opacity textures/values.From Michael Platings: added "LightmapTextures" plugin option that changes the way textures are interpreted so Alessandro's models appear correctly. Also refactored to put many functions in one class to avoid passing around too many arguments to functions.

From Jan Perciva with changes from Robert Osfield, "I am submitting improved osgGA camera manipulators. Changes: - new mouse wheel zoom/movement/center functionality - ability to fix vertical axis (important for CAD) - possibility to specify values as absolute values or relative to model size - kind of backward compatibility by flags passed to constructor - and much more - restructuring classes to use kind of hierarchy and standard way of event processing (handle methods). This way, there is much more code reusability and it is more easy to develop new kinds of manipulators.Briefly, the new architecture keeps MatrixManipulator as base abstract class. StandardManipulator is the feature-rich standard manipulator with two main descendant classes: OrbitManipulator and FirstPersonManipulator. OrbitManipulator is base class for all trackball style manipulators, based on center, rotation and distance from center. FirstPersonManipulator is base for walk or fly style manipulators, using position and rotation for camera manipulation.
"

Changes by Robert: Replaced osg::Vec3 by osg::Vec3d, introduced DEFAULT_SETTINGS enum and usage.  Added frame time member variables in prep for improving throw animation when vysync is off.

Hope it could work and get more feedbacks soon.I've added a new option "SchemaData" to the osg2 plugin. Developers
may test the new feature with the command line:

# osgconv cow.osg cow.osgb -O SchemaData

It will record all serializer properties used in the scene graph, at
the beginning of the generated file. And when osgviewer and user
applications is going to read the osgb file, the inbuilt data will be
automatically read and applied first, to keep backwards compatibility
partly. This will not affect osgb files generated with older versions.

From Martins Innus: The current fbx writer doesn't seem to support BIND_PER_VERTEX for normals.  If you have this type of geometry it, exports the the first normal in the array over the whole primitive set.  I don't know that the attached change should be applied as is, since I don't know enough about DrawArrays and Draw Elements to know if the indices for the vertices and normals are guaranteed to be the same.  I tried it on a couple models and that seemed to be the case. The alternative is to have the logic down in setControlPointAndNormalsAndUV and set the normals there with the "vertexIndex"  if the binding type is per vertex.  Not sure what is cleaner.

From Wang Rui, "I've just made another OSG+Qt (GUI) examples to demonstrate how to create OSG views, add them to a CompositeViewer, and add corresponding widgets to Qt layouts or as popup windows. The example inherits a GraphicsWindowQt from the GraphicsWindow base class and implements most of the virtual methods. A QGLWidget is created at the same time to perform keyboards and mouse events, who is also added as the main widget's child.The new example, named osgviewerQtContext (because of deriving from GraphicsContext), works fine on Windows XP SP3 and Qt 4.5.0, with 4 widgets in QGridLayout and a popup window and 60Hz frame rate. I haven't tested it on Unix/Linux and Mac OSX yet. So any feedback from these platforms is appreciated. I wish this example be a useful complement to current osgviewerQt and osgviewerQtWidgets ones. :)

Some unfinished functionalities: inheritedWindowData, sharedContext, and more tests needed."

From Wang Rui, "The OSG book I'm working on will focus on helping beginners build latest OSG source code with Visual Studio 2010 express, without setting too many options and without facing unexpected errors. But at present, the compilation process will fail because the INSTALL project 'cannot find' generated DLLs while copying files. I have looked into the build directory and found that the places of generated file folders were just different from previous VS versions. In this case, the old hack in OsgMacroUtils.cmake may become invalid:MACRO(HANDLE_MSVC_DLL)
       #this is a hack... the build place is set to lib/<debug or
release> by LIBARARY_OUTPUT_PATH equal to OUTPUT_LIBDIR
       #the .lib will be crated in ../ so going straight in lib by
the IMPORT_PREFIX property
       #because we want dll placed in OUTPUT_BINDIR ie the bin folder
sibling of lib, we can use ../../bin to go there,
       ...
       ELSE(NOT MSVC_IDE)
           SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES(${LIB_NAME} PROPERTIES PREFIX
"../../bin/${LIB_PREFIX}${LIB_SOVERSION}-" IMPORT_PREFIX "../")
       ENDIF(NOT MSVC_IDE)
ENDMACRO(HANDLE_MSVC_DLL)

Here the prefix "../../bin" may need to be fixed. I just modified it to:

IF(MSVC_VERSION LESS 1600)
    SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES(${LIB_NAME} PROPERTIES PREFIX
"../../bin/${LIB_PREFIX}${LIB_SOVERSION}-" IMPORT_PREFIX "../")
ENDIF()

It should keep compatible with old MSVC versions. There are similar
fixes in the SETUP_PLUGIN and SETUP_EXE macros. I haven't tested them
on more platforms.

Fixed the background quad size to fit all the camera stats labels

Tue, 20 Apr 2010 10:59:44 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Tim Moore, "I noticed that the "Materials" statistic in the camera scene stats display seemed to be identical to the number of drawables. In fact, it displays the nummat member of osgUtil::Statistics, but that variable has nothing to do with materials. nummat tracks the number of matrices associated with Drawable objects in a RenderBin; as I understand it, Drawables pretty much always have a model-view matrix tied to them in RenderBins, so this statistic doesn't seem very useful. So, I added statistics for the number of StateGraph objects in RenderBins and also for the number of Drawables in the "fine grain ordering" of RenderBins. The latter corresponds to the number of Drawables in the scene that are sorted by some criteria other than graphics state; usually that is distance for semi-transparent objects, though it could be traversal order. These two statistics give an idea of the number of graphic state changes happening in a visible scene: each StateGraph implies a state change, and there could be a change for each sorted object too. You can also subtract the number of sorted Drawables from the total number of Drawables and get an idea of how many Drawables are being drawn for each StateGraph. "

From Stephan Huber and Mathieu Marache, "attached you'll find framework support for os x via cmake. Please credit Mathieu Marache, he added the last missing piece to this puzzle.I think it is safe to commit these changes to trunk, as the traditional
way via dylibs should work as before.

Here's some more info how to get frameworks:

With these modifications it is possible to compile frameworks on OS X,
when you set the Cmake-option OSG_COMPILE_FRAMEWORKS to true. If you
want to embed the frameworks in your app-bundle make sure to set
OSG_COMPILE_FRAMEWORKS_INSTALL_NAME_DIR accordingly.

You'll have to build the install-target of the generated xcode-projects
as this sets the install_name_dirs of the frameworks and plugins."

Skeleton::UpdateSkeleton.
A bug fix in the Seralizer header which avoids setting default values
to objects.
Naming style fixes in osgAnimation headers and sources, also in the
deprecated dotosg wrappers.
A bug fix for the XML support, to write char values correctly.
A small change in the osg::Geometry wrapper to ignore the
InternalGeometry property, which is used by the MorphGeometry and
should not be set by user applications.

The avatar.osg, nathan.osg and robot.osg data files all work fine with
serializers, with some 'unsupported wrapper' warnings when converting.
I'm thinking of removing these warnings by disabling related property
serializers (ComputeBoundingBoxCallback and Drawable::UpdateCallback),
which are seldom recorded by users.

By the way, I still wonder how would we handle the C4121 problem,
discussed some days before. The /Zp compile option is set to 16 in the
attached cmake script file. And is there a better solution now?"

handle byte ordering in read & writing.  So the net result is that the
swap is done twice.

The solution is simply to remove the custom osg code, and use the
stock lib3ds code.  The attached files are against today's revision
11331.  I've tested on Sparc & Intel.

I put an additional conditional statement here to ensure that
_cameraWithCamera and _camera are different, otherwise it's no need to
calculate the transition matrix from main camera to focus camera. The
excess calculations of 'matrix' and 'new_coord' may cause
floating-point error and return a slightly wrong result other than an
identity matrix. It seems OK in most cases but will be still pain when
there is little difference between two mouse moving events. "

That helps when as we are building both vs71 and vs80, and probably vs90 in the future at the same time in addition to not having to rename the directory once it is downloaded.

From David Fries,"We are needing to compile Debug, Release, and MinSizeWithDebInfo, but currently only Debug appends "d" so the Release and MinSizeWithDebInfo (and MinSizeRel) all produce the same filenames.  This set of changes lets each build type have a cmake defined string appended, defaulting to Release none, Debug d, RelWithDebInfo rd, MinSizeRel s.  But a user still can have Release, RelWithDebInfo, and MinSizeRel to produce the same filenames.  It does so by setting the preprocessor define OSG_LIBRARY_POSTFIX in src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt to one of the previously defined cmake variables CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX CMAKE_RELEASE_POSTFIX CMAKE_RELWITHDEBINFO_POSTFIX CMAKE_MINSIZEREL_POSTFIX.  This method cuts down on the #ifdef _DEBUG #else preprocessor directives in Registry.cpp as the extension is always passed in OSG_LIBRARY_POSTFIX.  That and __MINGW32__ didn't have the _DEBUG check which looks like a bug."

I also added support for Billboard's points, so now "osgconv lz.osg lz.3ds" has an acceptable output. However, there is no rotation depending on billboards' axis, hence the notice "Warning: 3DS writer is incomplete for Billboards (rotation not implemented).". You may want to remove this notice (or lower the notify severity) if you feel 3DS doesn't have to handle such rotations. The attached archive contains 3 files from 3DS plugin, against rev. 11162.Please note there is still the textures issue for cow.osg. I guess it's because it's not a "flat, dummy and standard" texture in slot 0... That is to say the only thing the writer can handle at the moment. I guess I won't address this soon.
"
and

"I've detected and fixed another bug in 3DS writer: support for automatic splitting of meshes having >65k faces/points was buggy (was deleting faces).
Here is my four 3DS modified files (in a ZIP), against rev. 11193, including previous fixes AND Stephan's fix about relative filenames."

From Wang Rui, "I've initially added the XML support of the new native osg format, using osgDB::XmlParser. The extension for XML-formatted scenes is .osgx, corresponding to .osgb for binary and .osgt for ascii. It could either be rendered in osgviewer or edited by common web browsers and xml editors because of a range of changes to fit the XML syntax. For example, the recorded class names are slight modified, from 'osg::Geode' to 'osg--Geode'.To quickly get an XML file:
# ./osgconv cow.osg cow.osgx

The StreamOperator header, InputStreram and OutputStream classes are
modified to be more portable for triple ascii/binary/XML formats. I
also fixed a bug in readImage()/writeImage() to share image objects if
needed.

The ReaderWriterOSG2 class now supports all three formats and
reading/writing scene objects (not nodes or images), thanks to
Torben's advice before.

From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Here comes a list of small fixes in StandardShadowMap and derived classes affecting LispSM techniques. Changes made against SVN trunk.Fixes in StandardShadowMap.cpp & MinimalShadowMap.cpp were made for spotlight issues. There were cases when further located spotlights were not shadowing properly.

Small tweak in DebugShadowMap & StandardShadowMap.cpp to not limit shadow maps to texture2D (which should also allow texture2D arrays and cube maps). I simply replaced ptr to osg::Texture2D with pointer to osg::Texture. Interpretation of this member could be now changed with change of shaders in derived classes. This may be useful for guys who override LispSM or MinimalBoundsShadowMaps techniques. Could be useful for implementation of PerspectiveCascadedShadowMaps technique for example.

ConvexPolyhedron.cpp & DebugShadowMap.cpp contain debug HUD tweaks.

Change in ConvexPolyhedron.cpp overcomes the regression problem with color per primitive binding which caused that shadow volume outlines stopped to draw. I simply changed PER_PRIMITIVE to PER_PRIMITIVE_SET and it works again.

Other adition is dump method I added to DebugShadowMap which can be used in shadow debugging mode to dump current frame shadow volumes & scene to osg file. It could be then loaded into viewer and freely examined from different angles (which is difficult inside the application if shadow adopts to view and projection). "

 * getPassed now exits early and returns true to avoid blinking / blink-in of geometry for the first frame or for out-of-range LOD children coming back into view.
 * getPassed now considers the distance from the near plane to the bounding sphere (rather than eye point to bounding sphere) when determining if the viewer is "inside" the bounding sphere or not."

From Terry Welsh, "As discussed on the osg-users list, I have implemented these rules in Text and Text3D:1.  A new line should be started after a line's last hyphen or before
its last whitespace.
2.  If no suitable place to break a line is found, just start new line
after the last character that fits on the line.
3.  Whitespace should be removed from the beginning of the new line
(already worked in Text, but not in Text3D).

Line wrapping looks a lot better now with no more lone periods
appearing at the beginning of lines.

Also, right-justified text is more accurate now (slashes would hang
off the end of lines before).  With this new code I spotted one
instance where a hyphen stuck out too far, but in general it looks
better.  Centered text was not perfect before and still isn't, but I
can't see any significant increase or decrease in quality.  The casual
observer would probably never notice a problem.

Also fixed a whitespace problem in Text3D.  Not all whitespace was
being removed from the beginning of lines.  Now it is all being
removed in the same manner as in Text."

From Erik Johnson, "There is an issue on win32 if the application hides the cursor using GraphicsWindowWin32::useCursor(false).  The cursor has a habit of re-showing itself.To reproduce, on win32:

-Run osgViewer in a windowed mode, with the cursor off, as such:
    osgViewer::Viewer::Windows windows;
    viewer.getWindows(windows);
    for(osgViewer::Viewer::Windows::iterator itr = windows.begin();
       itr != windows.end();
       ++itr)
    {
       (*itr)->useCursor( false );
    }

-Quickly move the cursor into the window  (cursor it should be hidden)
-Resize the window by dragging the border (notice the cursor changes to "resize" cursor)
-Move the cursor back to the inside of the window (notice the cursor is not hidden anymore)

The attached SVN patch will set the cursor to a "NoCursor" during useCursor(false).  This correctly stores the no cursor state, so it can be rejuvenated after a future cursor change.  This patch also fixes a couple instances where a hidden cursor should show itself, like when it's on the title bar, or the window close button."

Texture::TextureObjectSet::discardAllTextureObjects is called, but this does not reset _tail. Now the texture object is again created and addToBack is called from Texture::TextureObjectSet::takeOrGenerate. In addToBack (line 612) _tail is now not 0 (although the list should be empty) and a loop is created from the texture object to itself. Then when the second view is deleted, Texture::TextureObjectSet::deleteAllTextureObjects loops forever. Setting _tail to 0 fixes it for me (see attached)."

Author : Robert Osfield
Refactored the osg::Referenced observerset code so that it now uses a dedicated ObserverSet class, which utilises a global recursive mutex that is dedicated to manage Observer and ObserverSet.The new global mutex for observers avoids problems with deadlocks that were occurring previously when
an osg::Refenced object was being deleted at the same time as on osg::ObserverNodePath.

Mon, 15 Feb 2010 20:14:32 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
Introduced new osg::ObserverNodePath class that robustly manages a NodePath in a thread safe manner, making it easier for users to track a NodePath even when nodes in the path get deleted.

Mon, 15 Feb 2010 20:12:53 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
Refactored the osg::Observer to introduce a new bool Observer::objectUnreferenced(void*) method that adds the extra capability of making it possible for Observers to assume ownership of a object that would otherwsie be deleted.Added a thread safe ref_ptr<T> observer_ptr<T>::lock() method for robust access to an observed object.  This
makes observer_ptr<> more equivilant to boosts weak_ptr.

Added osg:: qualifyer to OSG_NOTIFY macro

Fri, 12 Feb 2010 11:45:00 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
Introduced OSG_WARN, OSG_NOTICE, OSG_INFO, OSG_DEBUG convinience macros that map to OSG_NOTIFY(osg::WARN) etc.Introduced the OSG_NOTIFY_DISABLE Cmake variable + include/osg/Config #define to control whether the OpenSceneGraph build
should disable the notification system completely.  By setting OSG_NOTIFY_DISABLE to ON in CMake and then rebuilding the
the OSG you can get a slightly smaller (~1%) and more slightly efficient library which can be good for shipping applications,
but with downside of reduced ability to detect runtime problems and their causes.

From Sukender, "- Added support for extended filenames (=not 8.3) for images: reads without crashing, optionnally write extended filenames (correctly truncate names if option is OFF). Write option is OFF by default. - Improved identifiers generation in duplicate name handling (was limited to 1000 name collisions, which can be very short for some usages). - Set all read/write operations use a custom log function that will redirect lib3DS log to osg::notify() (was only used for streams) - Removed custom code (now uses osgDB::getFilePath()) - Added missing supportsOption() calls - Cleaned a few minor things"

From Alberto Luaces, "he new GNU linker, "gold", is going to replace soon the current ld in almost all Linux distributions. Although it is 100% compatible with ld, by default it gives an error if a library has unresolved symbols at link time, that is, it has set -Wl,--no-undefined by default. Debian folks have found that libosg.so and libosgDB.so use some functions belonging to libdl.so {dlsym,dlopen,dlclose,dlerror} without linking to it.My changes link those two libraries to libdl.so explicitly in the same
way it is already done for libm.so and librt.so."

From Wang Rui, "Just a minor fix of the src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt, change:SET(COMPRESSION_LIBRARIES ${ZLIB_LIBRARY})
...
LINK_EXTERNAL(${LIB_NAME} ${OSGDB_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_LIBRARIES})

to

SET(COMPRESSION_LIBRARIES ZLIB_LIBRARY)
...
LINK_EXTERNAL(${LIB_NAME} ${OSGDB_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_LIBRARIES}
${COMPRESSION_LIBRARIES})
LINK_WITH_VARIABLES(${LIB_NAME} ${COMPRESSION_LIBRARIES})


I notice that the LINK_EXTERNAL macro won't distinguish between debug
and release dependences, which means that osgDB will use the release
version of zlib for all build configurations. Under Win32, this will
cause a manifest problem: all applications using osgDB may complain
"failed to start because msvcr80.dll was not found" or similar
messages.

This change will make it back to normal."

From Jan Peciva, "I am sending improved version of Inventor plugin. Attaching just modified files, while GroupSoLOD.h and .cpp was deleted. Please, delete it from repository, it is not used any longer and I doubt if it is probably not used for anything meaningful for a while. In the new code, there is no GroupSoLOD. Please, delete it.I am using new plugin version for about 1.5 month so I consider it
stable by myself.

List of changes:
- rewritten Inventor state stack
- shaders support
- light attenuation support
- support for reading from stream (readNode(std::istream& fin, options))
- improved grouping node handling (SoSeparator, SoGroup,...)
- fixed transformation bug when two SoShapes/Drawables with different transformations are placed bellow one grouping node
- introduced preprocessing to handle more advanced usage schemes of SoLOD and SoSwitch nodes
- unused code clean up
- improved notify messages
- animation callbacks fixes
- FindInventor.cmake improved finding routines, support for Coin3 and Coin4"

From Wang Rui, "Changes:1. Rewrite the reading/writing exception handlers to work like the ive
plugin exceptions.
2. Write a header writing/checking function in ReaderWriterOSG2.cpp,
which may help decide if the stream is ascii or binary. The
readInputIterator() function will return null pointer if the input
file is nither osgb nor osgt format, which indicates that the old .osg
format could be used here, in case we've merged the two plugins
together.
3. Add a new ForceReadingImage option in the InputStream, which will
allocate an empty image object with the filename if specifed external
image file is missed. It may be useful for format converting in some
cases.
4. Add new osgParticle wrappers, as well as some modification to the
osgParticle headers, for instance, change isEnabled() to getEnabled().
5. Some fixes to the osg serialization wrappers."

From Cedric Pinson, "Here a list of changes: Bone now inherit from MatrixTransform. It simplify a lot the update of Bone matrix. It helps to have the bone system more generic. eg it's now possible to have animation data with precomputed bind matrix. The other benefit, is now the collada plugin will be able to use osgAnimation to display skinned mesh. Michael Plating did a great work to improve this aspect, he is working on the collada plugin and should be able to submit a new version soon. The RigGeometry has been refactored so now it works when you save and reload RigGeometry because the source is not touched anymore. The benefit with this update is that it should be now possible to use a MorphGeometry as source for a RigGeometry.The bad news is that the format has changed, so i have rebuild osg-data
related to osgAnimation data, updated the blender exporter to export to
the new format.
The fbx plugin could be touched about this commit, i dont compile it so
i can't give more information about it.
The bvh plugin has been updated by Wang rui so this one is fixed with
the new code of osgAnimation.
The examples has been updated to work with the new code too...

The example osg-data/example.osg should be remove, it's an old example
that does not work.

For people using blender the blender exporter up to date is here:
http://hg.plopbyte.net/osgexport2/
it will be merge to http://hg.plopbyte.net/osgexport/ as soon as the
modification will be push in the trunk.

It notifies the user when the size is not as requested, but I could find no way for the program to detect this. I've added two lines to write the new size back into the _traits, I think this is appropriate, but I am not absolutely sure.

In PixelBufferX11 was no support, so I've added GLX_LARGEST_PBUFFER(_SGIX) support, with the same writeback to the _trais.


I have tested the GLX_LARGEST_PBUFFER version on linux and the WGL_PBUFFER_LARGEST_ARB with windows, all tested with the modified autocapture I just submitted.


"autocapture --pbuffer --window 100 100 18192 18192 cow.osg.\[0,0,-22.7\].trans"
gives me a 4096x4096 image on my windows machine,
and a 8192x8192 image on linux."

From Jan Peciva, "I am sending one more improvement (separately from Inventor plugin). I found very useful to have a control whether osgView::setCameraManipulator does or does not reset camera to home position.I extended method signature as follows:
void setCameraManipulator(osgGA::MatrixManipulator* manipulator, bool resetPosition = true);

keeping the current usage intact (default parameter), while enabling user to disable the position reset. That can be useful in the situation when manipulator position was already loaded, for example from a file (user specification), or defined any other way, while we do not want to be reset to home position. Other usability is usage of two manipulators in a modeling program (orbiting around the model, walking on the model) and changing between them while we want to preserve the position of a camera in the change. Games may benefit from it as well when we change from user-defined helicopter manipulator to soldier manipulator because the user escaped the helicopter. The camera will change manipulator but the position is expected to be kept in the transition (provided that user makes the state transition between the two manipulators himself).

From Lars Nilsson, "Attached is a small program doing intersection calculations, both with and without KdTree. The geometry is a TRIANGLE_STRIP consisting of five vertices, all with the same rather high Z-value. If the intersection calculation uses KdTree, it fails. When I changed osg::Vec3 to osg::Vec3d in a few places in osg::KdTree it finds the correct intersection point."From Robert Osfield, I didn't merge the change of parameter type of IntersectKdTree::intersect() as the internal maths is all done in Vec3s. Keeping Vec3 here hasn't effected the test results.

From Laurens Voerman, "I've removed an underscore in OpenSceneGraph/src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp introduced in svn 10915 (5 Jan 2010): "Added support for call root Camera CullCallbacks"It causes a segfault in osgViewer based apps on our linux system (OSG_STEREO=ON OSG_STEREO_MODE=QUAD_BUFFER)

Problem does not show when OSG_STEREO=OFF.


< 976        else _cullVisitor->traverse(*_camera);
> 976        else cullVisitor->traverse(*_camera);

Looks like a typo, and removing the _ does fix the problem."

Renamed ObjectRegistry to ObjectWrapperManager, and replaced it's instance() method usage with assigning a ObjectWrapperManager to the osgDB::Registry.  Added a osgDB::Registry::getObjectWrapperManager() for access of this object wrapper manager.  This change centralises the singleton management in osgDB.Merged the osgDB::GlobalLookUpTable functionality into ObjectWrapperManger to keep down the number of singletons in use.

Author : Robert Osfield
From Wang Rui, "Attached are two simple modifications of osg::Sequence and osg::Texture1D classes, for the reason of implementing the I/O serialization feature. In the Sequence header, I've added some more convenient functions: setTimeList/getTimeList, setLoopMode/getLoopMode, setBegin/getBegin, setEnd/getEnd, setSpeed/getSpeed and setNumRepeats/getNumRepeats.In the Texture1D header, fixed:

inline void setTextureWidth(int width) const ...

to:

inline void setTextureWidth(int width) ..."

Notes from Robert Osfield, have gone a little further with these changes and have removed some of the original get methods that were out of step with the way the rest of the OSG manages the set/get property pairs.

From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "OK, so here are new changes.1. The node type will be set to ATOM on read of <tag prop="..." ... /> type tags.
2. GROUP and NODE are now written using the same code (and not just duplicated code). Also NODE will not be written as an ATOM if it has no children or contents, so you need to set the type to ATOM if you want the <tag ... /> style.
3. You had put the write of "/>" for ATOM after the "return true", so it had no effect... Moved to before the return.
4. ATOM did not write its properties correctly, fixed.
5. As an added bonus, I made the write() method indent the output so it's more readable. It brings a small public interface change but the indent argument has a default value so client code doesn't need to change (if there even is any).
6. Another added bonus, I've simplified the write() method a bit by factoring out the write for children and properties into protected methods."

From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "was testing an osgWidget-based test app I have and noticed that I couldn't move the windows/frames around on the screen anymore. Turns out that the virtual methods' interface changed in the EventInterface base class, the third argument to mouseDrag() is now const, but it was not changed in the derived classes, so it still compiled but the derived-class version was not being called because its arguments differed.Here are the changes that fix it.

From Rob Radtke, "I recently ran into some issues trying to save/load a scene graph as a .ive file.  The problems came about because the scene graph contained depth textures in it.  I have attached a patch (against the current revision: 10919) that fixes the issues that I encountered.  Both attachments contain the same patch--one is a .zip file that contains the modified files and the other is a text patch file.  Here is a summary of the changes I made:1) Add getShadowComparison() accessor function to osg::Texture class
2) Modify ReaderWriterTiff::writeTifStream() and _readColor() (in Image.cpp) to handle pixelFormat==GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT as if it were GL_LUMINANCE
3) Modify the Texture classes of the ive and osg plug-ins so that they save/load the following Texture members: _use_shadow_comparison, _shadow_compare_func and _shadow_texture_mode

From Lilith Bryant, "As discussed previously on the users list.   Fixes the redundant calls to glActiveTexture on every State::apply after more than one texunits have been used.This is against 2.9.6 (I think SVN head is the same)

Quick Synopsis:

New functions:

State::applyModeOnTexUnit
State::applyAttributeOnTexUnit
State::applyModeMapOnTexUnit
State::applyAttributeMapOnTexUnit
State::applyModeListOnTexUnit
State::applyAttributeListOnTexUnit

All copies of the normal versions, but they also set the active tex unit if
absolutely necessary (i.e. only if they call something OpenGL).

State::apply (*2)
State::applyTextureAttribute

Changed to call the above functions and no longer call setActiveTextureUnit
themselves.

State::setActiveTextureUnit

Made inline, so the benefit of having applyModeOnTexUnit (etc) inline
is retained.

Refactored the way that osg::Image/ImageSequence manages the update callback that needs to be attached to Textures to make it possible to use the Image::update() mechansim in other subclasses from osg::Image. To enable the automatic attachment of the required update callback to call osg::Image::update(..) subclasses from osg::Image will need to implement the osg::Image::requestUpdateCall() and return true, and implement the osg::Image::update(NodeVisitor*) method to recieve the update call during the update traversal.

From Fabien Lavignotte, "i have a problem with my application, i am currently playing with Texture2D::SubloadCallback to optimize my image data transfer, and also avoid double buffering when using a drawing thread. There is a small bug with your change and SubloadCallback, the texture object is destroy at each call of Texture2D::apply because the modified count is never updated when using SubloadCallback. I have made a small fix to avoid that, see attachement."From Robert Osfield, added an if (_image.valid()) before the getModified() that Fabien added to avoid problems when no _image is assigned but an subload callback is.

From Tatsuhiro Nishioka, "> The workaround/solution was to add a block of code at the end of the > loader to un-premultiply the alpha (now in the codebase).Applying the code brightens the semi-transparent portion, but the black edges are still there (same on both osgviewer and FlightGear).
Therefore I believe that the alpha channel is completely ignored (on png, gif, tiff, etc...). I tweaked and tweaked and finally got a workaround.

Please commit the enclosed file to fix these issues.

My workaround is a bit tricky (and some lines are even weird for me), but it resolves the black edges.
These workarounds also work on GIF, TIFF, TGA, and PSD as long as I've tested so far.

Short changelog (from rev 10819): - Added 3DS writer - Sync'd with latest lib3DS - Added options, especially "flattenMatrixTransforms" to get the "old" behaviour (else the reader correctly maps to OSG the transforms from the 3DS file).What should be done:
- Check with pivot points, with and without "flattenMatrixTransforms" option.
- We ran tests on it, but we can never be 100% sure there is no bug. Testing from the community would of course be helpful."

reserve() inside the loop. This allows std::vector<> to reuse the old
memory instead allocating new when the new size <= oldsize."

It performed the first check (color_0 <= color_1), but it didn't actually scan the texel block to see if the transparent color (0x03) was there.  As a result, DXT1 files without any alpha were getting switched to RGBA format (instead of being left just RGB).The attached code fixes this problem."

From Jean-Sebastien Guay, Explanation:Currently osg2cpp removes "\n" line endings to replace them with a textual equivalent ("\\n") in order for the string representing the shader to contain line endings in the string. But if the file that was read contained Windows line endings ("\r\n"), the resulting file looked really weird (the \r were left there and editors interpreted that as an additional newline). Also, I can imagine that if the shader file that was read had Mac line endings ("\r") then the output shader would all end up in one long line since there are no "\n"...

What I've done:

I've added a search and replace of "\r\n" to "\n", and then "\r" to "\n" (note that the order is important).

I've also changed the filename handling so that the output file will be put in the same directory as the input file in case it was specified with a path. Previous functionality is retained for files specified with the filename only.""

In this case, OSG failed to propagate the clear mask to the slave Cameras, resulting in the clear mask being ignored. To fix this issue, this revision adds a new CullSettings::VariablesMask bit, CLEAR_MASK, to explicitly control inheritance of the clear mask. This bit is set by default, which means that the clear mask now inherits by default, whereas previously it did not."

From Chris Denham, "I discovered what seems to be a missing call to FreeLibrary for osgDB.dll The result of this is that it prevents me from dynamically unloading my DLL (which uses OSG). This is because initialisation of the osg::Registry instance results in a call to GetModuleHandleEx (to get the filename of the DLL). This call to GetModuleHandleEx increments the module refcount, but there was no matching call to FreeLibrary for the returned handle. Unlike the old GetModuleHandle function, GetModuleHandle does (by default) increment the refcount.I have added the missing call to FreeLibrary in osgDB::FileUtils., and now my the runtime unload of MY dll is working properly. It has also cured some related problems I was having with memory leak checks being reported.

From Colin MacDonald, "In my application I have a custom graphics context class, derived from osg::GraphicsContext, in order to give good integration with the application's GUI toolkit.  This works really well.However, I need to share OpenGL texture resources with the standard
osgViewer GraphicsContext implementations, in particular the
PixelBuffers.  This is essential for my application to conserve graphics
memory on low-end hardware.  Currently the standard osg implementations
will not share resources with another derived osg::GraphicsContext,
other than the pre-defined osgViewer classes e.g. PixelBufferX11 is
hardcoded to only share resources with GraphicsWindowX11 and
PixelBufferX11 objects, and no other osg::GraphicsContext object.

To address this in the cleanest way I could think of, I have moved the
OpenGL handle variables for each platform into a small utility class,
e.g. GraphicsHandleX11 for unix.  Then GraphicsWindowX11, PixelBufferX11
and any other derived osg::GraphicsContext class can inherit from
GraphicsHandleX11 to share OpenGL resources.

I have updated the X11, Win32 and Carbon implementations to use this.
The changes are minor.  I haven't touched the Cocoa implmentation as
I'm not familiar with it at all and couldn't test it - it will work
unchanged.

Without this I had some horrible hacks in my application, this greatly
simplifies things for me.  It also simplifies the osgViewer
implementations slightly.  Perhaps it may help with other users'
desires to share resources with external graphics contexts, as was
discussed on the user list recently."

Notes from Robert Osfield, adapted Colin's submission to work with the new EGL related changes.

From Chris Hanson, " Remove vestigial (and because it was undocumented, potentially harmful) code to ignore filenames starting with a dash "-" character from the (std::vector<std::string>&) version of osgDB::readNodeFiles. Handling of argument strings is properly implemented in the osgDB::readNodeFiles(osg::ArgumentParser& arguments,const Options* options) variant, which most code uses. The (std::vector<std::string>&) version is only called by the osgconv utility, which does its own argument handling and stripping prior to calling readNodeFiles(). Also, documented this behaviour in the header comments.

 I believe this code removal is a meritful change because leavign the code in causes an
unexpected and undocumented behaviour (ignoring any filename starting with a dash) that
could bite users in the future. This behaviour is not needed for existing functionality
because existing code uses other APIs to handle dash-prefixed arguments anyway.

That is, just swap the positions of two 'if () {...}' segments.

While working on a paged terrain, I need to collect every newly allocated PagedLODs and make them temporarily unrenderable in the next frame, which are all done in a update callback. But I found that these PagedLODs will always be shown before collecting them, because of the unsuitable sequence in Scene::updateSceneGraph(). DatabasePager is synchronized AFTER the user updating traversal, that is, user cannot IMMEDIATELY find out changes made by DatabasePager.

If OSG is compiled without the flag COMPILE_ASSEMBLY (default behaviours) the clear() function is an empty

From Himar Carmona, " this submission resolves an issue regarding the setup of a slave camera with an (incorrect) coding style. Sharing the same instance of osg::Viewport with a camera and a slave camera causes incorrect rescaling in GraphicsContext::resizedImplementation, due to the viewport being rescaled twice (once per camera). Though viewports sharing is not intentional, it can be done with the current version of OSG and be a potential pitfall for anyone.   As Robert pointed out, i opted for modifying the resize code where the break is to minimize code changes, avoiding the duplicate resize of the viewport with the use of a vector and a search for duplicates. Not very elegant (avoiding an effect of a cause), another approach could be ripping out the method osg::Camera::setViewport(osg::Viewport*) which is more inline with Roberts rationale behind not to share viewports between cameras and left only its overloaded method setViewport(x,y,width,height). But this approach need some refactoring due to the intense use of the method. Notice also that the resize works well without this change if no sharing occurs, and the user of the method can opt for always call setViewport with a new instance.
 "

Note from Robert Osfield, changed this submission to use an std::set<Viewport*> rather than an std::vector<> as it keeps the code a bit cleaner and more compact.

From Jason Beverage, "I posted a question on osg users about resources not being properly released when using osgTerrain databases and multiple viewers are used a few weeks ago and I've found that at least part of the problem comes down to the fact that the nodes that are traversed by the GeometryTechnique are never actually added to the scene graph, and thus don't have releaseGLObjects called on them.  I'm submitting a few changes that takes care of this by allowing the TerrainTechnique to provide a releaseGLObjects implementation.  I've applied these changes in osgEarth and this example program no longer crashes on the second run, although I get corrupt geometry (see attached shot) which could be down to a driver issue.  If I increment the context ID for the second viewer, I no longer get the corrupt geometry.The attached changes are against OpenSceneGraph 2.8.2.

you can use a graphedit application to list devices available in

for classic avi file you just need to do a
osgDB::readImageFile("file.avi.directshow");
You will need of course to install the codec needed by directshow to
read the avi files.

I recommand this tool http://avicodec.duby.info/, that check which

From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a bugfix for removeTransformUpdating and another similar remove-method.The old code removed an element from a vector, which invalidates the
iterator of the loop This resulted in a crash on certain platforms. Now
the erasing is done the right way without invalidating the iterator."

From Vincent Gadoury, "In osgViewer::Viewer and osgViewer::CompositveViewer, the DOUBLECLICK event type was not considered as a "pointer event" and thus was receiving the event state coordinates and button mask. As a result, a double-click event always had a button mask not including the double-clicked button, even if double-click event is a "button push" event.The modification consists only in including osgGA::GUIEventAdapter::DOUBLECLICK in the list of "pointerEvent" events.

Test done to reproduce the problem and check the fix: in any osg application or example with an HandleInput function, break on events with a double-click event type. Without the changes, the event's buttonMask does not contain the double-clicked button. With the changes, it does.

Only simple tests (running some examples and playing with the mouse) were done to check that the changes do not break anything, since double-click is not used thoroughly in OSG.

Modification done against current SVN Trunk version (r10753).

As this is a fix, I do not wish to keep my copyright on this submission and assign it over to the project lead.

From Tugkan Calapoglu, "we started to have problems with textures after a recent svn update. I was able to follow the problem until following addition to Texture.cpp:// GLES doesn't cope with internal formats of 1,2,3 and 4 so map them to
the appropriate equivilants.

if (_internalFormat==1) _internalFormat = GL_ALPHA;
if (_internalFormat==2) _internalFormat = GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA;
if (_internalFormat==3) _internalFormat = GL_RGB;
if (_internalFormat==4) _internalFormat = GL_RGBA;


The problem is that internal format "1" corresponds to GL_LUMINANCE, not
GL_ALPHA. I double checked this from the Red Book. Fixed version is
attached to the email."

From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "I've made a change to the ScreenCaptureHandler's addCallbackToViewer method, so that it iterates over GraphicsContexts instead of GraphicsWindows. When the viewer has a pbuffer (for offscreen rendering without a window) then it wouldn't add the WindowCaptureCallback to that context since it wasn't in the list returned by ViewerBase::getWindows(). And anyways, I originally wrote the code, and I didn't see any reason why I did it with windows instead of contexts...I've needed to run a recorded simulation offscreen and save it to a sequence of images, and the ScreenCaptureHandler seemed to be the simplest way to do that, and with this change it's possible.


Another change: I've also added the ability to specify continuous capture of all frames, or a certain number of frames. ScreenCaptureHandler now has a setFramesToCapture(int) method. The argument will be interpreted as:

0  : don't capture
<0 : capture continuously
>0 : capture that number of frames then stop

I also added startCapture() and stopCapture() methods so that user code can start capturing (either continuously or the given number of frames) at a given point in their program. setFramesToCapture() won't start capturing, you have to call startCapture() afterwards. The handler also now has another key to toggle continuous capture (defaults to 'C').

Note that continuous capture will of course only work if the CaptureOperation writes to different files (for example, a WriteToFile with SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER mode) or does something different each time... Otherwise it will just overwrite of course. :-)

I've also taken the chance to refactor the addCallbackToViewer() method a bit too, since finding the right camera is needed in two places now.

I've tested all cases (I think). If you want to try, in osgviewer.cpp and replace the line

 // add the screen capture handler
 viewer.addEventHandler(new osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler);

with

 // add the screen capture handler
 osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler* captureHandler = new
     osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler(
         new osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler::WriteToFile(
             "screenshot", "jpg",
     osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler::WriteToFile::SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER),
     -1);
 viewer.addEventHandler(captureHandler);
 captureHandler->startCapture();

And vary the "-1" (put 0, 10, 50) and then use the 'c' and 'C' keys and see how it reacts.

From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Building on earlier Paul's submission "[osg-users] Main branch MSFBO support change", I have added implicit buffer mask variables to DisplaySettings for setting global defaults for Camera FBOs. These mask variables are named after variables in Camera class. In Paul's submission they were named _renderBufferMask & _resolveBufferMask but I renamed them to _implicitBufferAttachmentRenderMask & _implicitBufferAttachmentResolveMask. DisplaySettings implementation includes reading of environment vars and command line options. Setters and getters follow typical OSG naming convention.  I also updated names of ImplictBufferAttachment enum bits to match changed naming scheme.DisplaySettings now define COLOR and DEPTH as defaults for implicit buffers. Consequently Camera by default uses the same defaults through USE_DISPLAY_SETTINGS_MASK. However, particular Camera mask can be easily overriden through Camera::setImplicitBufferAttachmentMask method. I hope, that in this way we can have global control over implicit buffer defaults, and we can still retain fine grained control at Camera level.

I have also replaced original unsigned ints used to store masks to signed ints because complier resolves enums as signed integer (I got a number of warnings with unsigned int)."

The previous behavior was to always smooth at all verticies which did not have surface normals. In this new implementation smoothing is on by default to be compatible with previous behavior.  The user can now specify the "generateFacetNormals" option to the reader to use facet normals for verticies where the OBJ file does not specify a normal."Note from Robert Osfield, changed "noSmoothing" naming used by Lee to "generateFacetNormals".

clock_gettime when it's available, and falling back to gettimeofday
when it's not."

From Wojciech Lewandowski, "ref_ptr usage changes made on 9th of June  broke VirtualProgram used in osgShaderCompositor example. Taking the opportunity I modified the code a little to use earth sphere as default model. Cow.osg used previously was not looking good in advanced example. I also changed default to advanced example, because its more informative with labels describing virtual programs used to render the objects."

From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "osgWidget::Window::setWindow() calls parented() (which does an addChild()) on the new window, but it does not call unparented() (which does a removeChild()) on the old window before. So it works fine if there was no window previously, but if an app creates new windows and calls setWindow() to replace the previous one, they will all add up instead and be on top of each other...This is fixed in the file attached."

From Michael Platings, In Target, the default constructor is explicitly called on _target. This is necessary for FloatTarget and DoubleTarget so that _target is initialised to 0, otherwise you get a junk value. In MorphGeometry.cpp, UpdateMorph::link now links channels of the same index to the same target. Previously a new FloatTarget was created for each channel, so multiple animations didn't work.

From Michael Platings, I have removed Target::normalize() as calling it was incorrect - the interpolation is already done in such a way that the Target's value is always normalized. Finally, I have fixed TemplateTarget<osg::Quat>::lerp() as it was giving incorrect results when interpolating between some small rotations. From Cedric Pinson, i renamed the method in channel to be more general. Adjusted the CubicBezier key constructor to use a single value as input.

From Michael Platings, "the DAE importer was crashing when calling osg::Object::setName with a null pointer argument. Rather than trying to fix all the places this might happen and probably missing a few, I thought it would be better to trivially validate the input in setName.

From Colin McDonald, "The bsp & mdl plugins have calls to atof() without including the associated <stdlib.h> header.  This breaks the build on my Solaris setup.Rather than adding the missing <stdlib.h> include, I have changed the
atof() calls to osg::asciiToDouble().  This is the same as was done
throughout the other plugins recently, for locale independance.

I've attached updates to the svn trunk, the fix is also appropriate for
the 2.8.* branch."

From Jason Daly, "This set of changes reworks the BSP plugin to use TexEnvCombine instead of a GLSL program for doing the texture blending on displaced terrain geometry.  After working with it a while, I found this method to be more scene graph friendly (at least until Wojtek gets his VirtualProgram scheme working  ;-) )Note that this technique will require ARB_texture_env_crossbar (or NV_texture_env_combine4), as it mixes two textures in the first texture unit, and just does the lighting in the second.  I doubt this will be a problem for any card that can already handle GLSL programs, though."

From Terry Welsh, "Okay, here are the mods I wrote for drawing a filled bounding box behind osgText::Text.  I made it so the box would get drawn using whichever BackdropImplementation was selected.  However, I did not implement STENCIL_BUFFER.  In that case it defaults to drawing the bounding box using POLYGON_OFFSET instead.Also made it so the BOUNDINGBOX and FILLEDBOUNDINGBOX are drawn with a
settable color and margin size.

While I was at it I tightened up the values applied with DEPTH_RANGE
and POLYGON_OFFSET, not just for drawing the bounding box but also for
drawing backdrop text (these values must be coupled since the bounding
box has to be drawn deeper in Z than the backdrop text).  The values
in use before seemed like overkill and I was seeing some z-clipping
with my background scenery in the case of DEPTH_RANGE.  If there was a
good reason for the large values please let me know...."

From David Fries, "Here is a fix for a deadlock seen under Windows using OpenThreads Barrier operations.  The error is with atomic operations in the win32 condition implementation.  The attached sample program will reliably trigger with as few as three threads and a dual core system, though sometimes it will take 65,000 iterations.2.8.1 was the base for these changes

Win32ConditionPrivateData.h
Win32ConditionPrivateData::wait does two operations to decrement
waiters_ then read, when InterlockedDecrement decrements and returns
the value in one operation.  The two operations allows another thread
to also decrement with both getting 0 for an answer.

Win32ConditionPrivateData::broadcast is using waiters_ directly
instead of using the w value read earlier, if it was safe to use
waiters_ directly there would be no need for InterlockedGet or w.

overview of deadlock in barrier with three threads
one thread in broadcast, 2 threads in wait,
release semaphore 2, waits on waiters_done_
both threads wake, decrement waiters_, get 0 for w,
       <logic error here>
one calls set waiters_done_,
broadcast thread comes out of waiters_done_,
other thread calls waiters_done_, (which leaves waiters_done_ in the
signaled state)
       <sets the trap>
broadcast thread returns releases mutex, other threads get
mutex and also return,
next barrier, first two threads enter wait, one goes to broadcast, release
semaphore 2, skips waiters_done_ as it had been released last time
returns, processes, enters the barrier for the next barrier operation
and waits,
three threads are now in wait, two have the previous barrier phase,
one the current phase, there's one count left in the semaphore which a
thread gets, returns, enters the barrier as a waiter, sleeps, and the
deadlock is completed"

From Lee Bulter, "I noticed that when "throwing" things the rate of motion once thrown was dependent on the complexity of the geometry. For complex scenes this meant that it looked like you were "throwing" the display into molasses. For simple geometry things get over-excited once thrown.The fix is to factor in the frame rendering time to the caluclated
motion. I've implemented this for rotation and panning.

Now when things are thrown they maintain a rate very close to what was
happening when the mouse button was released."

might argue that these should be locale dependent. But IMO these should be

From Farshid Lashkari, "I found a bug in the osgText library in version 1.2 that I believe still exists in the latest version.I found that changing the alignment of a text object does not work properly if the text contains newline characters. I've attached a simple test case that shows the problem. If I set the text AFTER setting the alignment, everything works fine. But if I set the text BEFORE setting the alignment then the text is displayed incorrectly.

The fix is very simple. Instead of calling computePositions() in TextBase::setAlignment(), it calls computeGlyphRepresentation(). I've attached the modified TextBase.cpp."

From Gino van den Bergen, "AFAICS, OSG's OBJ loader correctly handles backslash-newlines that are used for continuation of lines. However, I recently ran into a problem with OBJs that where converted from another source using Right Hemisphere Deep Exploration. In these OBJs newlines are escaped in the following way:f  15939/9999/16177 15941/10000/16178 15940/10001/16179\
15938/10002/16180

In the OBJ loader the newline would be interpreted as follows

f  15939/9999/16177 15941/10000/16178 15940/10001/1617915938/10002/16180

However, for correctly loading the model it should be interpreted as

f  15939/9999/16177 15941/10000/16178 15940/10001/16179 15938/10002/16180

Thus, the escaped newline should be interpreted as a space.

I tried to lookup what the correct interpretation for a backslash-newline was in the OBJ spec but did not find anything useful. Nevertheless, my suggestion would be to adopt replacing the escaped newline by a space in order to avoid problems as stated above. I cannot imagine a meaningful usage of a newline within a numerical literal so I do not foresee cases where replacing a backslash-newline by a space would be harmful. The fixed obj.cpp is zipped and attached to this mail."

From Tom Jolly, "A new compiler and a new warning.Enclosed is include/osgParticle/Particle.  I removed the const from the
return type of getSTexCoord.  I also changed the name on the next
function to getTTexCoord so it is consistent with getSTexCoord.  If you
prefer to change getSTexCoord to getSCoord you will need to change it in
ConnectedParticleSystem.cpp."

From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Here are my changes:- osg::Texture sets GL_MAX_TEXTURE_LEVEL if image uses fewer mipmaps than
number from computeNumberOfMipmaps (and it works!)
- DDS fix to read only available mipmaps
- DDS fixes to read / save 3D textures with mipmaps ( packing == 1 is
required)
- Few cosmetic DDS modifications and comments to make code cleaner (I hope)

Added _isTextureMaxLevelSupported variable to texture extensions. It
could be removed if OSG requires OpenGL version 1.2 by default.

Added simple ComputeImageSizeInBytes function in DDSReaderWrites. In
my opinion it would be better if similar static method was defined for
Image. Then it could be used not only in DDS but other modules as well (I
noticed that Texture/Texture2D do similar computations).

Also attached is an example test.osg model with DDS without last mipmaps to
demonstrate the problem. When loaded into Viewer with current code and moved
far away, so that cube occupies 4 pixels, cube becomes red due to the issue
I described in earlier post. When you patch DDS reader writer with attched
code but no osg::Texture yet, cube becomes blank (at least on my
Windows/NVidia)  When you also merge osg::Texture patch cube will look right
and mipmaps will be correct."

From Alberto Luaces, "the new changes in osgAnimation showed some errors on the Cygwin platform:1 - osgAnimation/StatsHandler includes <cmath>, but on Cygwin only std::isnan
is defined that way. I changed it to <math.h> as it is done in the rest of
the OSG.

2 - Pulling some osgViewer headers from the same file in osgAnimation makes
the former a new dependency. Thus, I got errors at osgAnimation linking time.
I wonder why nobody noticed this on other platforms. I have updated the
CMakeLists.txt file in order to link to the needed libraries, and

3 - I have updated the openscenegraph-osgAnimation.pc.in file accordingly."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Mathias Froehlich, "attached is a change to the ProxyNode that also includes ProxyNode local database options like recently added to PagedLOD.Also there is a change to the traverse method:
The previous ProxyNode checks the VisitorType to be a CULL_VISITOR and the
presence of a request handler to submit a database request.
In contrast to that PagedLOD uses the request handler if it is there - even if
the visitor type is not a cull visitor.
The change removes the cull visitor test from the ProxyNode so that it behaves
like the PagedLOD.
I believe that the presence of a request handler in a visitor might be
sufficient to trigger the requests as this is done in the PagedLOD anyway.

Based on rev 10332."



Fri, 12 Jun 2009 10:00:08 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Stephan Huber, "here are some small fixes/enahncements for the cocoa backend to allow proper functioning when running the osgViewer run-loop in a secondary thread (e.g. when embedding GraphicsWindowCocoa-windows in a full blown cocoa application).OS X is picky when you want to change the user-interface from another
thread than the main thread, not all UI stuff is thread-safe. So now
window closes and showing / hiding the menu bar is done in the main
thread via Cocoa's performSelectorOnMainThread-mechanism.

These changes don't affect the normal osgViewer usage pattern."

From Emmanuel Roche, "I've updated the CURL plugin to support the CURL_CONNECTTIMEOUT and CURL_TIMEOUT options.Those two additional options can now be set using the Options::setOptionsString() function (just like the already existing OSG_CURL_PROXY & OSG_CURL_PROXYPORT options).

This is a convient solution to limit the freezing effect one may face in case the targeted server is down or too slow.

I successfully compiled and used this updated version on Windows in my application.

And by default those settings are not set (so no change in the behavior if you don't need them).

From Gustav Happalahti, fixed filename usage

Mon, 8 Jun 2009 16:50:50 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Gustav Haapalahti and Robert Osfield,First Submission email from Gustav:
"This submission adds a --cache option to osgconv and osgviewer that enables setObjectCacheHint(osgDB::Options::CACHE_ALL); It greatly reduces memory usage when a .osg file has lots of external references with ProxyNode:s that points to the same file.

Options are also added to the osg plugin. The code was already mostly implemented but there was no way to change the options.
includeExternalReferences
writeExternalReferenceFiles
A counter is added to keep track if an external file has already been written down to avoid writing the same file over and over again. If it has already been written once then it is not written again.
The counter is added to the Output class in osgDB.
"

Second Submission email from Gustav:
"This is a continuation to my previous submission.
I noticed that the same problem that I fixed in ProxyNode.cpp for the osg plugin (external files being written over and over again) also existed in the ive plugin. I attached a submission where the ive plugin remembers which external files that have already been written and do not write them again."


Changes to the above done by Robert Osfield,

    changed command line parameter to --enable-object-cache
    changed set/get methods in osgDB::Output and ive/DataOutputStream.cpp to be s/getExternalFileWritten(const std::string&)
    cleaned up set up of osgDB::Options.

Martin Beckett, "Here's a first attempt at a DXF writer pluginAt the moment it outputs DXF for whatever geometry is contained in the node it would be nice to draw the model as it is rendered (points/lines/surface)

If people could also test against other apps that need to read DXF, the format is a bit of a black art and not all importers support all features so it might need some options to tweak the output.

It has some rather clever colour lookup stuff to match real colours against the limited DXF palette. I cracked the code of the Autocad indexed colours!"

From Mathias Froehlich, "Without this change packed depth stencil attachments are only supported if the GL_EXT_framebuffer_blit extension is available. This is due to the early return from the constructor if this is missing. As far as I read the standard extension documents, this blit call is not required to have packed depth stencil fbos. The change fixes this and allows packed stencil attachments on machines without the multisample blit command."

From Neil Hughes, "Two changes here...1. I've implemented an option controlled route by which users can still access the old method of extracting the zip content to the local filesystem. This is in response to Ulrich's comments about zip files encorporating files other than those that OSG knows about, but which an application may require.

To access this the user makes the following call on their options object that they pass to the reader. Without it, the plugin will extract by default to memory.

local_opt->setPluginStrData("zipextract","filesystem");


2. The second change is that I've moved the declaration of one of the variables to within the numitems loop so that if loading of a specific file within the zip fails, subsequent files still load correctly. This was the issue that Ulrich raised."

From Martin Beckett, "In MatrixManipulator can we have computeHomePosition() use _homeUp rather than the hardcoded (0,0,1). This makes it possible to redefine the viewing direction of 'home' in the other manipulator - so home in a GIS app could be a plan view. Since _homeUp is set to (0,0,1) and no current code changes it there shouldn't be any difference for current users."

From Ross Anderson, "Symptom: The computation of TerrainTiles containing only image layers (no elevation layer) is incorrect. The resulting bounding sphere will always have a radius of zero.The fix is to remove the call to bs.expandBy(v) and compute the radius directly. I believe this call was intended to be bs.expandRadiusBy(v), but it is superfluous when the radius is computed directly."

From Maciej Krol,"With advent of GUI applications in OSG there is a growing need to redirect notification messages to third party systems. For example windows applications do not have console output, it would be appropriate to redirect notifications to GUI widget or debug output. I have revamped notification system to fit this need. New notification stream is using NotifyHandler as a message sink. Handler is called whenever stream is synchronized (i.e. after <<std::endl). Standard streams std::cout and std::cerr are no longer used although by default StandardNotifyHandler is a message sink. Custom notification handler can be set with osg::setNotifyHandler(NotifyHandler *) function.Two implementations of NotifyHandler are currently available:
- StandardNotifyHandler, calls fputs(message, stderr) for severity <= WARN and fputs(message, stdout) for severity > WARN
- WinDebugNotifyHandler, windows users can redirect notifications to windows debug output, notifications can be viewed in output window of the debugger i.e. MSVC or DebugView (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx) (see screenshot).

I have seen on osg-users that some people do std::cerr.rdbuf(otherStream.rdbuf()) to redirect notifications. This trick will no longer work since osg::notify() returns internal osg::NotifyStream not std::cout or std::cerr. You can use osg::notify().rdbuf(otherStream.rdbuf()) to do this instead.

Additionally I've made some minor fixes:
- Minor imrovements to osg::notify documentation
- NullStream could crash by deleting stream buffer other than default NullStreamBuffer in the destructor i.e. after osg::notify(osg::DEBUG_FP).rdbuf(otherStream.rdbuf())"

From Paul Obermeier, "Please find enclosed some changed OSG header files. The changes are more or less just beautifications (when looked at them from the C++ view), but make wrapping OSG with SWIG easier. I have tested the changes with both 2.8.1-rc4 and the current head and would appreciate to incorporate the changes in both branches.Here is a description of the changes:

osg/BoundingSphere:
   Use the following typedef (like used in BoundingBox)
       typedef typename VT::value_type value_type;
   instead of
       typedef typename vec_type::value_type value_type;

   SWIG reports errors on the latter construct.
   Also makes it consistent with BoundingBox.


osg/Vec4ub:
   Consistent use of "value_type" throughout the file.


osg/Vec?b:
   Consistent use of "value_type" throughout the files.

   Also changed
       typedef char value_type;
   to
       typedef signed char value_type;

   In the case of a simple "char", SWIG assumes a string.
   Using "signed char" instead of "char" does not change
   the behaviour of the class.

From Thibault Genessay, "On Windows, when a process tries to spawn one too many thread, _beginthreadex() fails but OpenThreads still waits on the startup Block before returning to the caller of OpenThreads::Thread::start(). This causes a deadlock. The return value of _beginthreadex() is actually checked, but after the call to OpenThreads::Block::block() so it is basically useless.Attached is a fix to move the check for the return value of
_beginthreadex() before the call to block(), so that start() can
return to the caller with a non-zero error code. This solves the
problem for me."

From Frederic Bouvier,  SetCursor fixes from GraphicsWindowWin32,Original email from Frederic at start of thread:
"he patch attached, made from r10068, fix two things, in other of importance :

- the selected cursor is never shown ( second change in file ). Only the left arrow is always displayed.
- remove the arbitrary ( in my sense ) limitation that the user cannot choose a cursor with the same shape that one used when resizing the window. This limitation doesn't exist for X11, and we have a diverging behaviour there ( first change in file ). Flightgear use the LeftRightCursor in look around mode."

Follow up email from Frederic (with changes that finally made it into this check in:
"I've just tested Mark's suggestion and it works perfectly, even when the
cursor goes to the border then come back inside the window.
But his patch doesn't seem to be based on the last revision of the
files, or at least not on the trunk, and there are more changes than
expected in them, including some loss from the previous patches.
The patch attached is based on r10068 of
src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp and r10067 of
include/osgViewer/api/Win32/GraphicsWindowWin32"

standard-conform with other platforms (plugins should be located in
osgPlugins-X.X.X/). Because of the wrong syntax of the conditional
compile the old code was not used anyway -- so no functional change.

From Chris Denham, "For me, on Windows, I also get a slew of these warnings when I move the window off screen. So, might be a bit fiddly to try and prevent frame update in all situations that SwapBuffers retuns false. I wondered if we could address this issue by only reporting the error if GetLastError is also non zero. Works for me! The value returned by GetLastError is zero when SwapBuffers is called for a minimized or off screen window, so we could just add a check for this. Just say the word, and I'll post my modified GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp to the submissions list. ;-) Cheers. Chris.e.g.

//------------- OSG- 2..8 ----------
void GraphicsWindowWin32::swapBuffersImplementation()

The ?OSGDB_WINDOWS_FUNCT_STRING? makro is defined as follows in that case



#define OSGDB_WINDOWS_FUNCT_STRING(x) L ## #x L"W"



Thus the second parameter cannot be converted from wchar_t to LPCSTR. Should we convert the second parameter from wchar_t* to LPCSTR or use the same definition for the ?OSGDB_WINDOWS_FUNCT_STRING? makro in both cases?



The second error occurs in the same file, line 669. The second parameter for the ?pGetModuleHandleEx? function should be defined as wchar_t, but it?s defined as ?static char static_variable? in the line 667."

From Jason Daly, "Currently, the .mdl plugin loads vertices in the native DirectX order, which is the reverse of OpenGL order.  This means that the back faces are currently rendered as front faces, and vice versa.This fix reverses the vertex order and sets up proper OpenGL facing.  I didn't notice this problem until I started using the plug-in in my own code (osgviewer seems to not enable backface culling)."

From Peter Amstutz, "Here is a simple change to osgViewer::GraphicsWindowWin32 to add a flag to WindowData to specify that the graphics window should not install an event handler of its own, per this discussion thread:http://www.mail-archive.com/osg-users@lists.openscenegraph.org/msg23734.html

The change is source compatible with current osg code and will not affect current users, it simply adds an additional parameter to the GraphicsWindowWin32::WindowData struct constructor and defaults to the current behavior.

Attached are the files "include/osgViewer/api/Win32/GraphicsWindowWin32" and "src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp" with my changes, based on svn revision 10045.  In addition, I have provided an svn patch file with the same changes for your convenience.

I have discussed the matter with my supervisor, and agreed that my company makes no copyright claim over this extremely trivial change (or to put it another way, we assign copyright to the open scene graph community.)"

Thu, 9 Apr 2009 18:26:04 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Santosh Gaikwad, ply plugin, based on Equalizer and other LGPL compatible sources."Attached is the osg-plugin for reading ply ( Stanford Triangle Format )  file. I have written  the plugin according to OSG standard and  have also added cmake build system. The plugin is working fine on both Linux and Windows and should behave similarly on other OS as well."

"I developed this plugin while working on a project based on Equalizer. So VertexData which I am using is taken from equalizer and modified to make them work as separate OSG plugin.
Before contributing this plugin to OSG community, I asked project manager of Equalizer project Stefen regarding potential licensing issues and this is what he has said

"The kd-Tree (VertexBuffer*) is LGPL-licensed, and the base ply loader (ply*) is BSD. As long as you leave the copyright notices intact, there is no issue."

so I think using these files in OSG should not be a problem.

As far as author of ReaderWriterPLY.cpp  is concerned I am the author. I am working for Darshan3d which is a subsidiary of VizExperts thats why I have put VizExperts copyright."

Thu, 9 Apr 2009 14:38:29 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "When creating a cylinder without a bottom or a top (in the traits, createBottom=false and createTop=false), the cylinder could still be picked by picking its (non-existent) bottom or top. This is because the PrimitiveShapeFunctor does not consider the traits when returning the cylinder's geometry for the picking test, and always returns geometry for the whole cylinder, with bottom, top and body.I have attached a fixed file where the traits are checked in the PrimitiveShapeFunctor where appropriate. They are checked for Box, Cone Capsule and Cylinder. These just mirror the checks that were already done in the DrawShapeVisitor.

(another instance where if the ShapeDrawable had just been osg::Geometry, there wouldn't have been a problem... :-) )

I also fixed a small typo in the file in two places ("implementated" --> "implemented")."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Glenn Waldron, "Here is a first cut at the mime-type support we discussed a little while ago (http://www.mail-archive.com/osg-users@lists.openscenegraph.org/msg23098.html)Background: when you access a file over HTTP, you cannot rely on a file extension being present; instead the file's mime-type is conveyed in the HTTP Content-Type response header. This facility adds a mime-type-to-extension map to the registry to handle this.

There are two new osgDB::Registry functions which are pretty self-explanatory:

void addMimeTypeExtensionMapping( mime-type, extension )
ReaderWriter* getReaderWriterForMimeType( mime-type )

I also added the file osgDB/MimeTypes.cpp which houses a hard-coded list of built-in types. I took the list from here (http://www.webmaster-toolkit.com/mime-types.shtml) and then pared it down to include mostly image and video types, editing them to map to existing plugins where possible.

In addition, I updated the CURL plugin to a) install a set of built-in mime-type mappings, and b) use them to look up an extension in the event that the target filename does not have an extension.

Here is a test case. This URL pulls down a JPEG (without a file extension):
osgviewer --image "http://us.maps3.yimg.com/aerial.maps.yimg.com/ximg?v=1.8&s=256&t=a&r=1&x=0&y=0&z=2"
"



Thu, 9 Apr 2009 09:25:34 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "As I discussed in the thread "Windows 7 beta: "The binary is not a valid Windows image."" on osg-users, I needed to add the /DYNAMICBASE linker option for executables to link properly in release mode on Windows 7 beta.http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.graphics.openscenegraph.user/42400

Since this is a workaround for a bug in a beta OS (which may or may not be fixed, since it's mentioned in their release notes so they may just leave it as it is) I've marked the option as advanced, default to OFF, and clearly documented it as being useful for Windows 7 only. I'd like to be able to test for Windows 7 directly instead of the blanket IF(WIN32), but I can't figure out if this is possible in CMake.

Here's the modified CMakeLists.txt. It's a small change, with low impact, but will be useful to others who test out this OS and when it comes out. Note that I'm not familiar with this option in general, and didn't get any feedback to my questions in the above-mentioned thread, one of which was: Could we just add this option to all builds? What is the impact? That's still unclear to me, but without it OSG executables don't build, and the article I linked didn't seem to present any ill effects to enabling the option."

Wed, 8 Apr 2009 13:21:59 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Mike Connell, "Here are some small fixes that allow you to specify the allowable deviation when creating polylines from arcs and circles in DXF files. Changes are against 2.8.0It adds two options:

Accuracy(x) - ensures the polyline will be within x units from the ideal arc/curve
ImproveAccuracyOnly - do not use the given accuracy 'x', if it would result in a worse curve than with the previous (2.8.0) implementation for a particular arc/curve.

As an added bonus there was a small bug in the existing implementation whereby the primitives were line strips but the vertices generated were actually suitable for GL_LINES, so the improved accuracy doesn't even have to come at a performance cost :-)"

From Glenn Waldron, "Attached is a patch for osgUtil::Optimizer. If you run the SpatializeGroupsVisitor on a scene graph containing Geodes, StateSets attached to Geodes can be lost.The problem is in SpatializeGroupsVisitor::divide(osg::Geode*, unsigned int) where the code creates a new Group and divides up the input Geode into one Geode per Drawable.

I fixed the problem by assigning the Geode's stateset to the new parent group.

To replicate the bug, see attached osg/dds files:

osgviewer b.osg -- model renders correctly
set OSG_OPTIMIZER="SPATIALIZE_GROUPS"
osgviewer b.osg -- textures are missing."

From Maciej Krol, "As promised to Roland I assembled simple shader generator. ShaderGenVisitor converts accumulated fixed function pipeline state sets to ones with shader programs. Generated state sets are attached to geometries and stored in ShaderGenCache for reuse.Very simple cases of state configuration are supported (all the ones I really need):
- single per pixel not attenuated non spot light source ON/OFF
- exp2 fog ON/OFF
- diffuse texture in rgb + optional specular gloss in alpha (Texture unit 0) ON/OFF
- normal map texture (Texture unit 1 and Tangent in VertexAttribArray 6) ON/OFF
- blending and alpha testing (not in shader pipeline)

To view fixed function pipeline files and paged databases simply run >osgshadergen myfile.osg"

From Frank Midgley, "I tried running osgconv --formats yesterday on OS X and got no results.  Turns out the changes discussed in the "osgDB::listAllAvailablePlugins win32 fix" thread back in Sep '08 broke this.  The OSG_PLUGIN_EXTENSION macro is being defined in src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt from CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX which is "dylib" on OS X.  The problem is that all of the plug-ins are setup in OsgMacroUtils.cmake with:       ADD_LIBRARY(${TARGET_TARGETNAME} MODULE ${TARGET_SRC} ${TARGET_H})

which gives them .so extensions.  Since ".so" != ".dylib" osgDB::listAllAvailablePlugins finds no plug-ins.  I believe the correct solution is to use CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX instead.  This builds and runs correctly on OS X but I have not tested on other platforms.

Attached is an updated src/osgDB/CMakeLists.txt based on rev 9915.  The change is at line 108.  To validate: build and then run bin/osgconv --formats.  You should get many screenfuls of plug-in features, extensions and options."

From Konstantin Sinitsyn, "At this moment, I just introducing to OSG. When I reviewing optimizer code, I find a mistake in Optimizer::RemoveLoadedProxyNodesVisitor, as it seems. This optimizer removes proxy nodes that fully loaded and in some cases attach their childs to parrents directly (without creating of group). I dont understand how this works, because if proxy node doesn't have any attributes such as name, description, node mask and any callbacks, then new group does not created to hold proxy node childs. And code below trying to attach their children to all parents but seems like only first child beeing attached to all parents correctly."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Michael Platings, "I've been looking at the discussion from 2006 ("[osg-users] osgDB/Reentrant Mutex not threadsafe ?") about this, and having looked closely at OpenThreads::ReentrantMutex it's still not thread safe in the following situation:In my example case, there are 2 threads - one is a worker thread created by OpenThreads::Thread. The other thread is the main thread i.e. the thread that is intrinsically created when you execute the application. The crucial problem is that for the main thread, OpenThreads::Thread::CurrentThread() will return null.
 
I'll demonstrate this by breaking ReentrantMutex::lock() into sub-statements:
 
1.) if (_threadHoldingMutex==OpenThreads::Thread::CurrentThread())
 
2.) if (_lockCount>0){
 
3.)
OpenThreads::ScopedLock<OpenThreads::Mutex> lock(_lockCountMutex);
++_lockCount;
return 0;
 
4.)
int result = Mutex::lock();
if (result==0)
{
OpenThreads::ScopedLock<OpenThreads::Mutex> lock(_lockCountMutex);
 
5.)
_threadHoldingMutex = OpenThreads::Thread::CurrentThread();
_lockCount = 1;
return result;
 
 
An error will occur in the following case:
1) The worker thread calls lock(), it gets to the start of statement 5.
2) The main thread calls lock(). Statement 1 is evaluated as true as _threadHoldingMutex is null, and OpenThreads::Thread::CurrentThread() returns null.
3) The worker thread executes statement 5.
4) The main thread executes statement 2 and evaluates it as true, because the worker thread has set _lockCount to 1. The main thread executes statement 3, and now can access the mutexed-data at the same time as the worker thread!
 
The simple solution to this is to always protect access to _lockCount and _threadHoldingMutex using _lockCountMutex. I have done this in the file I am submitting."

From Neil Hughes, "I've spent the past four days playing with PNG files on 3DS objects, and I think I may have come across a small issue with the 3DS loader.At the company where I work we model literally thousands of 3DS models for all types of objects. Most don't have transparent textures applied to them, but a few do. The issue is that a texture may have an alpha channel defined, yet its 3DS material definition is not marked as being an alpha source, or transparent. This can happen for any number of modelling reasons (so I'm told) but the net effect is that when a 3DS object is loaded with such a material applied, the stateset creation for the 3DS geometry omits to add the GL_BLEND attribute as neither of the conditions that it currently tests for are satisfied under this scenario.

However, one thing that is apparently an indication of transparency/alpha information that we do make use of when modelling, but that the 3DS reader omits to test, is that we assign to the transparent texture to the opacity_map of the 3DS material structure.

Now, having discussed with our modellers the theory behind the opacity map, it seems that it is safe to say that if an opacity map is specified, then the reader should really apply the GL_BLEND attribute as it is an indication of some form of blending being required between materials.

With this in mind, I have made a minor change to the function createStateSet below, from the ReaderWriter3DS.cpp file, that checks for an opacity map having been specified, and in such a scenario the GL_BLEND attribute is applied to the geometry. This fixed our issue, and thought it might be helpful to others."

From Lionel Lagarde, "the attachment contains a correction of the Optimizer::MergeGeometryVisitor. When 2 geometries are merged, the primitive sets of the second geometry are copied to the first geometry.The primitive sets were copied with a std::insert into the first geometry
primitive set vector. It doesn't work when the geometry is using VBOs (because
the element buffer object of the primitive set is not updated).

The correction replaces

lhs.getPrimitiveSetList().insert( lhs.getPrimitiveSetList().end(),
                                rhs.getPrimitiveSetList().begin(),
                                rhs.getPrimitiveSetList().end() );

DeleteHandlerPointer already in Referenced.cpp to return an zero pointer for
the global referenced lock if it is already destroyed."

From Ralf Habacker, "The appended patch fixes this issue by adding a virtual method named supportedFeatures() to the class ReaderWriter, which could be overriden by a specific plugin to adjust the set of features. Single features are implemented as bits asother enums in ReaderWriter class already does, so that combinations are possible and fast comparison operations are possibleBy default all features are enabled.

I have added this virtual method to the dot plugin to get an idea how to use these features.

With this patch osgconv --formats shows an additional line 'features' for each plugin"

Author : Robert Osfield
From Roland Smeenk, "While working on the Collada plugin I noticed that all geometry created by the dae reader result in slow path geometry. Because there already exists the option to convert slow path geometry to the fast path by computing an internal fast path alternative, I added a new optimizer option that automatically does this. To check the results I also made some changes to the statistics gathering and rendering.Somewhat unrelated, but also part of the optimizer I disabled removal of CameraView nodes during RemoveRedundantNodes optimization.
As discussed on the ML, CameraViews were removed from the scenegraph. This solves that issue.

Summary:
-Geometry::areFastPathsUsed now also looks at internalOptimizedGeometry
-Added Optimize option to make all slow path geometry compute their internal fast path alternative
-Added fast geometry counter to the statistics
-Disabled removel of CameraViews in optimizer

Author : Robert Osfield
From Stephan Huber, "Attached you'll find a proposal for using different protocols. The idea behind the new code is:1.) plugins/apps register protocols which they can handle. This is done
via osgDB::Registry::registerProtocol(aProtocolName). Plugins register
supported protocols as usual via ReaderWriter::supportsProtocol(..), the
Registry is updated accordingly.

2.) osgDB::containsServerAddress checks first for an appearance of "://"
in the filename and then checks the protocol against the set of
registered protocols via Registry::isProtocolRegistered(aProtocollName)

3.) the other getServer*-functions changed as well, there's even a
getServerProtocol-function


With these changes filenames/Urls get routed to loaded plugins even with
different protocols than 'http'."

Tue, 10 Mar 2009 10:56:00 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From David Callu, "Problem:      osgText::Text and osgText::Text3D use the same font file.      The first really load the file and obtain an osgText::Font object,      the second use the cache created during the first load of the      font file, and so obtain an osgText::Font object instead of      osgText::Font3D object. To obtain an osgText::Font3D object,      osgText::Text3D call osgDB::readObjectFile(...) with an option      to specify the plugin we want an osgText::Font3D instead of      osgText::Font.Generalised Problem:
    In osgDB::Registry, loaded file cache is referenced by the name
    of this file, so if I load a file with some options, and the cache
    already contain object for this filename, I obtain an object
    potentially not loaded with my options.

Behaviours:
    Cache management is delegate to osgDB::Registry, but cache
    coherence (load a file with option then reuse it, deactivate the
    cache when load a specific file or don't cached the loaded file)
    is user's responsibility.

Text3D solution:
    Postfix the font file name by .text3d or something similar and then have the freetype plugin return
    osgText::Font3D when it detects this.
    This operation is done by osgText::readFont3DFile() which unsure the filename have .text3d as extension.
    This is totaly transparent for user, and backward compatible.


BTW, I fix the bug about the Normal of 3D text. Currently, the front and wall face have
the same normal (0,0,1) in the Text3D object coordinate. Now the wall face have its own
normal array computed by the plugin.

BTW 2, I implement
- void Text3D::accept(osg::Drawable::ConstAttributeFunctor& af) const
- void Text3D::accept(osg::PrimitiveFunctor& pf) const
so now statistics are well reported.

From Roland Smeenk, "Attached is a small bug fix for the redundant messages that are created in OSG applications on windows. GraphicsWindowWin32::setCursor is called every frame from the WM_NCHITTEST message. This will result in a call to ::SetCursor(_currentCursor) every frame, which again causes a WM_MOUSEMOVE to occur. The fix exits GraphicsWindowWin32::setCursor if the requested cursor already is the current cursor."

From Atr Tevs,first email:
"in the current implementation of osgUtil::RenderStage::drawInner() method, there is some wrong assumptions made. The problem is, that whenever one does use multisampling functionality, the Blit operation (which suppose to copy the content of multisampled FBO into the usual one) doesn't perform well in some cases.

I've attached a corrected version of the RenderStage. It do just add one line, which enables the multisampled FBO as a readable just before the usual FBO is set as writable. With these corrections the Blit operation performs now correct and allows using of multisampled rendering results further."

second email:
"There was a problem when blitting the multisampled FBO with internal formats. The default internal format of color buffered multisample FBO was GL_RGBA. This has converted the color values whenever the FBO content was copied. I've added couple of lines, which do just enable the multisampled FBO internal format in respect to the attached color texture's internal format. This makes it possible to blit even float valued texture, so make HDR with multisampling possible ;)"

From Martin Beckett, "I have added support for DXF POINTS to the dxf reader plugin It's really just a cut-paste job from the existing LINE support.The current dxf plugin architecture isn't very efficient, especially if you
are loading large point clouds (LIDAR)
eg. it makes multiple lookups of the layer name for each vertex.
I don't know if I can improve this for the general case or if I have to add a
special large point cloud dxf reader."



Fri, 20 Feb 2009 11:30:33 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Himar Carmona, "When reading a DXF file, the reader breaks at a debug assertion at vector (it breaks on release version). Inspecting the code show that the cause could be in dxfEntity.cpp.It seems that the problem is an offending "short" used in a for loop, where it should be "int" or "long". It causes an index out of range error. "

Author : Robert Osfield
From Riccardo Corsi, "in attach you'll find a patch to cleanup a little bit the (de)initialization code of QuickTime environment from the quickTime pluging. It basically removes the static init() and exit() functions,and move them inside the observer class (the one that cleans everything up when the last media is unloaded).It also add an extra check to clean up on exit if the QuickTime env is initialized, but no media is succesfully loaded / written (it might happens with streaming resources).

I tested it under WinXP with zero, one and multiple videos.

Stephan reads in copy: could you kindly check if everything runs smooth under OSX as well? Also, have you got a chance to test it with streaming media?

From Paul Melis, "While trying out the osgbrowser example (where I had forgotten to update LD_LIBRARY_PATH so the XUL libs would be found) I noticed that although the gecko plugin was found it could not be loaded. But this did not trigger any visible warning/error message (at least not without INFO notify level). Would you mind if we change the notify level for a dlerror() to WARNING? This will also make it more explicit for the case when a plugin isn't actually found, which seems to come up a lot for novice users (e.g. no freetype on win32, so no freetype plugin, etc). Also, the current error message is misleading ("Warning: Could not FIND plugin to ...") because the it's not always a case of not finding the plugin. I slightly enhanced the situation of not finding a plugin versus finding it but not being able to load it.Here's also a few fixes to some of the examples:
- osgfont: make usage help line more in line with the actual behaviour
- osgcompositeviewer: complain when no model file was provided
- osgmovie: don't include quicktime-dependent feature on Linux
- osgocclussionquery: comment addition (as I was surprised that lines
were being drawn in a function called createRandomTriangles())"

From Jason Daly, "Somehow, one of the shaders in the bsp plugin started behaving incorrectly between the original submission and now.  I suspect it has to do with a typo in the setup of the shader that was fixed at some point, or it happened during the recent warnings purge.  In any case, I had to invert the usage of a parameter in the shader to make it behave properly again.The vtf plugin wasn't working in Windows due to OS differences in the byte-packing of the header structure (on Windows, the big block read was causing a buffer overrun).  I fixed this by reading the structure from the file field by field.  It's now happy on both Linux and Windows."

From Mattias Helsing, "this is a semi-submission based on what you and others have been talking about in the LIB_POSTFIX thread. It is a bit verbose perhaps and the message I emit during the make install step flashes by and gets burried under all "installing..." and/or "up-to-date..." messages. I have posted on the cmake mail list on ways to do this better.The submission adds:
* message to user during configuration that s/he's eventually going o
install to ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}lib${LIB_POSTFIX}
* if system has /etc/ld.so.conf.d and it is a dir generates
packaging/ld.so.conf.d/openscenegraph.conf and creates a custom target
for installing it (target must be run explicitly of course). User is
notified of this during configuration (may not be necessary)
* emit a message during installation that libraries are put in
<same-as-above>. This message unfortunately gets emitted to soon for
the user to see it

* I added "COMPONENT libopenscenegraph-dev" to the pkgconfig.pc's
install command
* Moved the section with OSG_CONFIG_HAS_BEEN_RUN_BEFORE as close to
the end of CMakeLists.txt as I dared. This is the intent of this
construct I think."

From Paul Melis, "Here is an updated osgViewer::StatsHandler. It has the following changes: - The text and dark background rectangles are now correctly placed, and slightly resized here and there. - All counters (vertices, etc) now use a fixed formatting with 0 digits precision, to prevent the text from being shown in scientific notation when the number get large (e.g. 6.34344e+6). I tested with a scene containing roughly 4 million vertices, to make sure its stats would display correctly.I also made slight changes to osgcompositeviewer (attached) to aid in
testing the stats display, specifically displaying of camera and view
names."

From Patrick Hartling, "I encountered a bug related to RTTI for subclasses of osg::Shape. The circumstances under which this bug occur are rather specific, but the basic problem occurs when one translation unit other than libosg.so constructs an object that is a subclass of osg::Shape and another translation unit other than libosg.so tries to perform a dynamic_cast or other RTTI-based operation on that object. Under these circumstances, the RTTI operation will fail. In my case, the translation units involved were an application and osgdb_ive.so. The application constructed a scene graph that included instantiations of subclasses of osg::Shape. Depending on how the user ran the application, it would write the scene graph to an IVE file using osgDB::writeNodeFile(). The dynamic_cast operations in DataOutputStream::writeShape() would fail on the first subclass of osg::Shape that was encountered. This is because there were two different RTTI data objects for all osg::Shape subclasses being compared: one in the application and one in osgdb_ive.so.The fix for this is simple. We must ensure that at least one member
function of each of the subclasses of the polymorphic type osg::Shape is
compiled into libosg.so so that there is exactly one RTTI object for
that type in libosg.so. Then, all code linking against libosg.so will
use that single RTTI object. The following message from a list archive
sort of explains the issue and the solution:

  http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/1688156

While the posting has to do with Boost.Python, the problem applies to
C++ libraries in general."

From Roger James, The changes are as follows:-1. Support for ambient occlusion maps.
2. A fix for the incorrect handling of normals on all geometries. The optimizer usually fixed this bug so it probably was not noticed very often.
3. A new option flag on the reader. "StrictTransparency"
          // Process transparent and transparency settings according to a strict interpretation of the spec
          // See https://collada.org/public_forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=1210
otherwise
          // Jump through various hoops to accomodate the multiplicity of different ways
          // that various people have interpreted the specification
4. Handling of texures in the transparent channel. This is allowed provided that they are the same texture that is specified in the diffuse channel. Accomodating a different texture would require use of programmable pipeline functionality which I have tried to avoid.
5. Handling of <bind_vertex_input> elements.

Wed, 21 Jan 2009 17:10:51 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Jason Beverage, "I realized today that there is an issue with the Registry changes I submitted to allow plugins to have the first go at URLs.The code works fine as is if the format plugin is not already loaded in memory.

If a plugin is already in memory, say the PNG plugin for example, then a call to readImageFile("http://server.com/image.png") will return FILE_NOT_FOUND because osgDB::findDataFile will not be able to locate the file.  So the Registry::read method is returning before the CURL plugin is given a chance to download the file.

I've made a few changes to the Registry to not return FILE_NOT_FOUND if the filename contains a URL that fix the issue."

From Mattias Helsing, "'ve finally finished the rework of the packaging support. It is streamlined for tgz and has most of the features that Robert, J-S and Sukender requested in december. I have an idea of how to discover the vc80 sp1 or not but haven't had time to implement. The script is completely reworked and now doesn't include cmakes' bundled CPack.cmake script at all. In summary:* filenames are
<package>-<osgversion>-<platform>-<arch>[-compiler]-<configuration>.tar.gz,
ex. libopenscenegraph-2.7.9-Linux-i386-Release.tar.gz,
libopenthreads-dev-2.7.9-win32-x86-vc80sp1-Debug.tar.gz

* targets (projects in msvs) are generated for each specified
component, a target that packages everything that is installed
(openscenegraph-all) and there's a target for running all other
packaging targets (Package ALL on msvs, package_ALL in unix
makefiles).

* It is possible to set the compiler in ccmake (cmake-gui, whatever you use)

* the top folder in packages is the same for all packages (OpenSceneGraph-x.y)

* the packaging support is limited with cmake-2.6.0 and not as
dynamic. With cmake-2.6.1 and later building the gdal plugin (for
example) will create a package_libopenscenegraph-gdal target. With
cmake-2.6.0 only the ones that are always built (libopenscenegraph,
libopenscenegraph-dev, openscenegraph, libopenthreads,
libopenthreads-dev

* i found a better way to decide whether cpack is available to guard
the BUiLD_OSG_PACKAGES option"

From Mattias Helsing, "Following reports by Alberto and Simon this submission reenables usage of cmake-2.6.0. As a side note I just installed cmake from the ubuntu repositories and got cmake-2.6.0-4ubuntu2 and this one produced the currect CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE (-O3 -DNDEBUG).  This CMakeLists is tested on linux with cmake versions 2.4.8, 2.6.0, 2.6.2 and 2.6.0-4ubuntu2* Added quotes around CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS var to help cmake-2.6.0 pick up
that it really is a string value

* Removed quotes around values that we set in
OSG_AGGRESIVE_WARNING_FLAGS. This makes OSG_AGGRESIVE_WARING_FLAGS be
of LIST type so the foreach constructs can behave as I planned."

From Don Leich, "Here are a couple of fixes for the file examples/osgviewerQT/QOSGWidget.cpp to address some OS X issues.  Most of these fixes were previously submitted by Julian Scheid.  However, this patch however should not break the example for non-OS X builds and has been tested on 64-bit Linux as well as Mac OS X 10.5.o  The value returned by QWidget::winId() is not usable as input for
WindowData under OS X the way it is for both Windows and Unix.  Julian's fix
for this uses the Carbon API.  Since the fix for X11 in unknown, it is now
assumed that OSG has been built with OSG_WINDOWING_SYSTEM='Carbon' for this
example to work at all when running under OS X.

o  The CompositeViewer version would hang on exit with the original timer start
argument.  Changing the argument value to match the non-composite version
seemed to cure the hanging.

o  Julian's patch altered the setGeometry position to 30/30 in order to see any
window decorations.  I did not have this problem, but left his changes intact.

o  The non-composite viewer needed it's camera initialization defered until
after the ViewerQOSG's Qt base class had been initialized.  Otherwise, the view
did not cover the entire window.

From Sergey Leontyev, "Some minor(but important) bug fixes for osgWidget:1. In WindowManager.cpp childRemoved method the second parameter "end" is misleading and

should be named "numChildren" instead. It represents how many children to remove.  As a result, the method was implemented incorrectly and failed to remove UI objects. So I fixed it.

 

replaced this:

 

void WindowManager::childRemoved(unsigned int start, unsigned int end) {
    while(start < end) {
        Window* window = getByIndex(start);

        if(!window) continue;

        if(_remove(window)) {
            window->_index = -1;

            window->unmanaged(this);
        }

        start++;
    }
}

 

with this:

void WindowManager::childRemoved(unsigned int start, unsigned int numChildren) {
 for (unsigned int i = start; i < start+numChildren; i++)
 {
  Window* window = getByIndex(i);

  if(!window) continue;

  if(_remove(window)) {
   window->_index = -1;

   window->unmanaged(this);
  }
 }
}

 

2. in Input.cpp

 

The cursor in Input did not get positioned correctly, probably as a left over from the TOP LEFT origin system which is now BOTTOM LEFT.

in method positioned()

replaced this:

    _cursor->setOrigin(x + xoffset + 1.0f, y - _cursor->getHeight() + 1.0f);

 

with this:

    _cursor->setOrigin(x + xoffset + 1.0f, y + 1.0f);

 

Now it is placed correctly.

It turns out the solution was pretty simple.I've made a small change to Registry.cpp that puts the CURL logic AFTER the URL has been passed to the plugin rather than assuming all URL's need to be downloaded by the CURL plugin.  This way, plugins can have first crack at the URL's, and if they don't handle it the previous CURL behavior kicks in."

From Roland Smeenk, "Attached you will find an improved Collada plugin to properly support camera's. A Collada camera will be added to the scenegraph as osg::CameraView. This allows the user to create a set of predefined camera viewpoints. I also added a new MatrixManipulator to osgGA called CameraViewSwitchManipulator and added usage of this to the osgviewer example. This manipulator allows switching between the predefined camera viewpoints. The current design limition I ran into is that a MatrixManipulator only manipulates the ViewMatrix, but for this particular  manipulator I also want to update the projectionMatrix of the camera when switching to a new viewpoint. This is not implemented because I don't know what would be the best way to design it. Any ideas?Furthermore Collada also supports orthographic camera's, where an osg::CameraView only supports a perspective camera. Would it be useful to create a CameraView with customizable optics for this?"

From Jason Daly, "'ve been busy working on the Source engine plugins.  There are several contributions in this submission:osgDB/FileUtils.cpp:
Needed this extra code to allow a true case-insensitive search.  This is because the HL2 map and model files are often sloppy with case.  For example, the file might look for materials/models/alyx/alyx_sheet.vtf, but the file is actually in materials/Models/Alyx/alyx_sheet.vtf.  In case-insensitive mode, the new code recursively disassembles the path and checks each path element without regard to case.  In case-sensitive mode, the code behaves exactly as it used to.  The new code is also mostly skipped on Windows because of the case-insensitive file system.  Previously, I did all of this with custom search code in the .bsp plugin, but this allows the user to tailor the search using OSGFILEPATH.  There are some instructions in the plugins' README files about this.

osgPlugins/mdl:
This is a new plug-in for Half-Life 2 models (as opposed to maps).  This allows you to load Source models individually, as well as allowing the .bsp plugin to load models (props) that are embedded into maps.  Mdl files can contain simple object (crates, barrels, bottles), as well as fully articulated characters with skeletal animations.  Currently, it can load the simple objects.  It can also load the characters, but it can't load the skeletons or animations.

osgPlugins/bsp:
This contains all of the changes needed to load props along with the basic map geometry.  There are also
several bugs fixed.

osgPlugins/vtf:
This is the loader for Valve's texture format.  Previously, we had agreed to put this in with the bsp plugin, but I didn't think of the .mdl plugin at that time.  It's conceivable that a user might want to load models individually (not as part of a map), so the vtf reader does have to be separate.  I also fixed a rather significant bug.

I tested all of this code on RHEL 5.2 (32-bit), and Fedora 9 (64-bit).  I'll be testing on Windows soon.

I also attached a simple .mdl file, along with it's associated files and textures.  Just extract the tarball into it's own directory, set your OSGFILEPATH to point at that directory, and load the model like this:

 osgviewer models/props_junk/gascan001a.mdl"

From Jean-Sebastein Guay, I recently had to reimplement screen capture functionality into our framework (which was broken since the switch from OSG 1.2 to 2.2 over a year and a half ago). I used the ScreenCaptureHandler which I had contributed right before OSG 2.6 shipped, bit I had to trigger the screen capture programatically instead of by a key press in some cases, so I added a convenience method to do that.It's a minimal change, it just calls an already existing protected method. It was trivial to subclass the handler to do it in our code, but pushing the change into OSG makes sense as it's generally useful to have it in the handler itself.

I also noticed that the handle() method was overridden from osgGA::GUIEventHandler but wasn't marked virtual. It wasn't intended that subclasses not be able to override it in turn, so I've added the keyword.""

When running a osg application within microsofts application verifier, that software checks tells me that we should not unlock an unlocked mutex.When I look at the posix threads mutex implementation, which does no unlock in
the destructor and where it is illegal to destroy a locked mutex, I conclude
that it is not needed for an OpenThreads::Mutex to do that unlock in the
win32 Mutex destructor.

Thus this patch based on rev 9358 removes that additional unlock in the win32
mutex implementations destructor."

From Tatsuhiro Nishioka, "I found a bug in GraphicsWindowCarbon. GraphicsWindowCarbon::requestWarpPointer() places the mouse pointer in a (global?) display coordination, but it must be in a local window coordination. This problem is critical because the mouse cursor can go off a window especially when you place the window on the secondary screen.Attached is the file to fix this problem.

I tested this modified file with the following situations (on FlightGear) and all works fine.
- two windows on two screens (each has one window).
- two windows on two screens (secondary screen has all windows).
- two windows on two screens (primary screen has all windows).

In all scenarios, warp requests (by right-click the mouse) successfully moves the mouse pointer to the center of the main window,
and it is what it's supposed to be in the flightgear."

The platform part is taken from CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and for windows I
change this to win32 or win64 based on CMAKE_CL_64. This might not be
necessary if the arch part has that information. This information is
taken from CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR. I only have 32bit here so if some

From Wang Rui, "Attachment is a plugin reading Biovision hierarchical files (.BVH) to generate character motion animations. BVH format is widely used by Character Studio of 3dsmax, MotionBuilder and other softwares, also supported by most motion capture devices. The plugin is based on the latest osgAnimation library of OSG 2.7.6 and will return a osgAnimation::AnimationManager pointer if using readNodeFile() to load it.Source and CMake files are:
 
CMakeLists.txt
ReaderWriterBVH.cpp
 
Also there are 3 example BVH files. The first two are captured from motions of human beings - maybe a kung-fu master here. PLEASE use command below to see the results:
 
# osgviewer example1.bvh -O solids
 
This will demonstrate the animating of a skeleton and render bones as solid boxes. Note that the motion assumes XOZ is the ground and has an offset from the center, so we should adjust our view to get best effects.
 
You may also use "-O contours" to render bones as lines. The viewer shows nothing if without any options because osgAnimation::Bone does not render itself. User may add customized models to each named bones as osganimationskinning does to make uses of this plugin in their own applications.

I was wondering to support a BvhNode in my osgModeling peoject before, but soon found it better be a plugin for animation. A problem is, how to bind real geometry models to the skeleton. Maybe we could have a bindingToNode() visitor in future to find geodes matching names of bones and add them as bones' children."

From Art Tevs, "here is a submission of an additional class of PixelBufferObejct, which implements more general way of handling with PBOs. Current osg implementation of PBO does use an attached osg::Image to copy data from. This is somehow only one way of using it and doesn't provide full functionality of PBOs.--------------------------------------------
Descripton:

The patch does provide a new class PixelDataBufferObject which is capable of allocating memory on the GPU side (PBO memory) of arbitrary size. The memory can then further be used to be enabled into read mode (GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER_ARB) or in write mode (GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER_ARB). Enabling the buffer into write mode will force the driver to write data from bounded textures into that buffer (i.e. glGetTexImage). Using buffer in read mode give you the possibility to read data from the buffer into a texture with e.g. glTexSubImage or other instuctions. Hence no data is copied over the CPU (host memory), all the operations are done in the GPU memory.


--------------------------------------------
Compatibility:

The new class require the unbindBuffer method from the base class BufferObject to be virtual, which shouldn't break any functionality of already existing classes. Except of this the new class is fully orthogonal to existing one, hence can be safely added into already existing osg system.

--------------------------------------------
Testing:

The new class was tested in the current svn version of osgPPU. I am using the new class to copy data from textures into the PBO and hence provide them to CUDA kernels. Also reading the results back from CUDA is implemented using the provided patch. The given patch gives a possibility of easy interoperability between CUDA and osg (osgPPU ;) )


--------------------------------------------
I think in general it is a better way to derive the PixelBufferObject class from PixelDataBufferObject, since the second one is a generalization of the first one. However this could break the current functionality, hence I haven't implemented it in such a way. However I would push that on a stack of wished osg 3.x features, since this will reflect the OpenGL PBO functionality through the classes better.

From Andy Preece,"To reproduce the bug:

   1. Create a template osg::Sequence node (and underlying geometry) but do not attach the node to the current active scenegraph.
   2. At some point during the rendering loop (perhaps on a keystroke) clone the sequence node (I use the call:

       dynamic_cast<osg::Node*>(templateNode -> clone( osg::CopyOp( (osg::CopyOp::CopyFlags)osg::CopyOp::DEEP_COPY_NODES ) ) )

   3. Set the cloned sequence node duration to a value that makes the animation run slower (i.e. 2.0).
   4. Start the cloned sequence (using setMode()).
   5. Repeat steps 2 \u2013 4 and observe that the cloned sequences do not run slow but run as fast, appearing to ignore the duration that has been set on them.

 

Looking at the \u2018good documentation\u2019 (2.4 source code), I see that _start is being set to _now (osg::Sequence::setMode(), line 192). Should this not _start not be set to -1.0?"

I have only tested it on windows XP 32 machine. So there might be some work making it work on other platforms.

The plug-in supports writing and reading EXR files. When writing it can use the data type GL_HALF_FLOAT_ARB(se ilmbase-1.0.1) and GL_FLOAT. When reading the data type always becomes GL_HALF_FLOAT_ARB. It supports textures with three and four channels.

When reading an exr file it automatically removes Alfa channel if it didn't store any information."

From Wojciech Lewandowski, "I have restored MSVC disabled warnings in osg/Export. Difference is they are now disabled only when OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS macro is defined. This macro is set through CMake options and autogenerated  in osg/Config. Simon suggested that it would be cool if we had more control over selected warnings. I tried to learn how to make selection of individual warning numbers possible, but had to gave up as my cmake skills were not sufficient. The only way I saw this possible would be adding one define for each MSVC warning number. But many definitions seemed too be to much clutter for osg/Config file so I rejected thar idea. For this it would be cool if autogenerated Config entries could more powerful than simple #define/#undef flags. Maybe Cmake gurus know how to do it.I have not reverted added Compiler options. I assume that one may want to have warnings enabled for the application but may not want to see them while OSG libraries and examples compile.

Modified files:

osg/Export   - now explicitly includes osg/Config to make sure OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS is read
osg/Config.in  - declares OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS flag to be added to autogenerated osg/Config
CMakeLists.txt - declares OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS as option with default ON setting

From Jason Daly, "This is a plugin (two, actually) that will allow OSG to load .bsp map files from Valve's Source Engine games (Half-Life 2, etc.).  One plugin (called "vbsp" to distinguish it from the Quake 3 bsp loader) reads the .bsp file itself, and the other ("vtf") reads the texture files.The set up for this to work is a bit more complex than most files, since the engine expects all files to be in a certain place, and it tends to mix case a lot.  I tried to explain everything in the VBSP_README.txt file."

This plugin has been integrated with the pre-exisiting bsp plugin.

From Ulrich Hertlein, "I noticed some regression in the BMP loader - some 8-bit (paletted) files wouldn't load anymore but simply crash.After taking a look at the current state of the BMP loader I decided it might be worth a shot at reimplementing that part.  For example: the current loader doesn't properly handle 1- and 4-bit files, incorrectly loads 16-bit files as intensity-alpha (they are RGB555), is full of dead code, and generally not in very good shape.

Attached is my re-implementation for review.

I've checked it against the test images from http://wvnvaxa.wvnet.edu/vmswww/bmp.html and models that use BMP files.

From Danny Valente, submitted bu Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Some context: In the past I submitted a fix to osgViewer::CompositeViewer where events would get wrong input ranges. Later, you made a change to set the eventState's current graphics context to the current graphics context. However, there's a problem in the sequence of events. Here's the recap (doing a graphical diff with the attached file will show this clearly):Before:

1. if the camera is not a slave camera
  1.1 set the eventState's graphics context to the current context.
2. if the current master view is not the view which has the focus
  2.1 set the current master view to be the view which has the focus
  2.2 use the new master view's eventState instead of the old one

Now as you can see from this sequence, the graphics context is set on the eventState before switching to the view which has focus (and thus using another eventState). So the new eventState, in the case we need to switch views, will contain an old graphics context, not the correct one.

Just inversing these steps fixes the problem:

1. if the current master view is not the view which has the focus
  1.1 set the current master view to be the view which has the focus
  1.2 use the new master view's eventState instead of the old one
2. if the camera is not a slave camera
  2.1 set the eventState's graphics context to the current context.

Now, the eventState will refer to the correct graphics context in both cases.

Attached is a fixed CompositeViewer.cpp (based on today's SVN) which does this. Note that some other things are done in the 1. and 2. cases, but they have no influence on each other so they can just be swapped without problems.

Here is the problem, osgViewer::CompositeViewer::eventTraversal sets the action adapter field in the EventVisitor always to the last view which received an event, instead of using the view which actually received the event, so determination of the correct view does not work. I looked at the code a bit, and moved the code for setting the action adapter to a IMO better place"

From Blasius Czink, "Among other things I added support for atomic operations on BSD-like systems and additional methods (for "and", "or", "xor"). "and a later post the same osg-submissions thread:

"it's been a while since I have made the changes but I think it was due to problems with static builds of OpenThreads on windows. I was using
OpenThreads in a communication/synchronisation library (without
OpenSceneGraph). It seems I forgot to post a small change in the CMakeLists file of OpenThreads. If a user turns DYNAMIC_OPENTHREADS to OFF (static build) OT_LIBRARY_STATIC will be defined in the Config.
Without these changes a windows user will always end up with a "__declspec(dllexport)" or "__declspec(dllimport)" which is a problem for static builds."

And another post from Blasius on this topic:

"I tested with VS2005 and VS2008. For 32 bit everything works as expected. For x64 and VS2008 I could successfully do the cmake-configure and then the compilation but I had occasional crashes of cmTryCompileExec.exe (during the cmake-configure phase) which seems to be a cmake bug. With VS2005 and 64bit cmake does not set _OPENTHREADS_ATOMIC_USE_WIN32_INTERLOCKED although the interlocked functionality should be there. If I place the source snippet from the CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_RUNS macro to a separate sourcefile I can compile and run the resulting executable successfully. Forcing OPENTHREADS_ATOMIC_USE_WIN32_INTERLOCKED (on VS2005/x64) reveals a bug in "intrin.h" which seems to be fixed in VS2008 but not in VS2005.

In case anyone is interested the lines:
__MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset(long *a, long b))
__MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset(long *a, long b))
__MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset64(__int64 *a, __int64 b))
__MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset64(__int64 *a, __int64 b))

should be changed to:
__MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset(long volatile *a, long b))
__MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset(long volatile *a, long b))
__MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset64(__int64 volatile *a, __int64 b))
__MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset64(__int64 volatile *a, __int64 b))

The worst thing that can happen is that interlocked funtionality is not detected during cmake-configure and the mutex fallback is used.
Which reminds me another small glitch in the Atomic header so I attached a corrected version.



    Why is the OT_LIBRARY_STATIC added to the config file? It is not needed anywhere.

OT_LIBRARY_STATIC is needed if you are doing static-builds on Windows. See my previous post on that.

From Panagiotis Koutsourakis, "We are using Open Scene Graph for an application and we need COLLADA support. While testing the pluggin we found a small bug and we are submitting a patch.The first attachment is a small program that creates a scene with two
pyramids, transformed by two instances of
osg::PositionAttitudeTransform. One of them is rotated 90 degrees in
the X axis, and the scene is exported both in the native OSG (.osg)
and COLLADA (.dae)  formats. In the first case the rotated pyramid is
displayed correctly whereas in the second the pyramid seems not to be
rotated.

In the COLLADA 1.4.1 specification (found at
http://www.khronos.org/collada/) it is specified that
"The <rotate> element contains a list of four floating-point values
[...] followed by an angle in degrees" but the plugin seems to write
the value in radians.

The problem seems to be in the method daeWriter::apply() that seems to
be writing the angle value in radians to the COLLADA file. The patch
can be found in the second attachment and is simply a call to
RadiansToDegrees wrapped around the angle.

It was tempting to change the name of the _offset member to _inverseOffset, or to maintain both variables, but in the end went for the minimal change."

From Jean-Sebastirn Guay, "Inspired by the latest additions to the StatsHandler, here is my own addition. It's a graph that helps show the variation of the various stats over time. It's clearer than just having bars for the last 10 frames or so, IMHO, since 10 frames go by pretty fast...The graph is displayed "under" (behind) the normal bar chart you get when you press 's' twice. It doesn't hide the normal stats, you can still read them without any trouble, and that way, it doesn't take any more screen space. It starts from the left, and will scroll left when there is enough data to fill the screen width. The graph lines have the same colors we're used to (except I made the event color a bit bluer, so it's not exactly the same as the update color). A screen shot is attached.

The lines get a bit confused when they're all overlapping at the bottom of the graph, but I think that's the least of our concerns (if they're all at the bottom of the graph - except FPS of course - then great!).

The only thing I'm not very keen about is that to make things simple, I clamp the values to a given maximum. Right now, the maximums I have set are:

* Frame rate: 100 fps (people have 60, 75, 85Hz refresh rates, so there's no one right value, but I think 100 is OK)
* Stats: 0.016 seconds (what you need to get 60Hz minimum)

This could be changed so that the scale of the graph changes according to the maximum value in the last screenful of the graph instead of clamping values. We would then need to display the scale for each value on the side of the graph, because if the scale changes, you need to know what it is at this moment.

I tried to make things easy to change, so for example if you don't like that the graph is in the same space as the normal stats bars, it's easy to move it anywhere else, and make it have other dimensions. The maximums and colors are also easy to change.

The impact on performance should be minimal, since it's one vertex per graph line that's added per frame, and vertices are removed when they scroll off the screen, so you'll never have more than say 1280 * (3 + ncameras) vertices on the screen at one time. No polygons, I used line strips. The scrolling is done with a MatrixTransform."

From Neil Groves, "Frequently I would like code that has a signature like: void foo(osg::ref_ptr<osg::Node> node) to work for osg::ref_ptr<osg::Group>, osg::ref_ptr<osg::Geode> etc. The behaviour of osg::ref_ptr does not mimic the behaviour of a raw pointer in this regard.To facilitate this possibility I have added a template copy constructor and a template assignment operator. These work for safe conversions like those in my previous example, but fail as desired for non-safe conversions since the template instantiation fails during the raw pointer copy/assignment.

The lack of this facility has appreciably handicapped development of generic algorithms applied to the scene graph, and I believe that this alteration will be welcomed by most of the community. If there are issues with antiquated compilers not supporting template member functions then perhaps a small piece of conditional compilation is in order.

I have made the change using the latest release version (2.6) as the base. The full file is attached.

I have not tested building the osg wrappers and the script binding code. I have tested the legal and illegal conversions of both copying and assignment to ensure that behave as expected on MSVC7.1, MSVC8, MSVC9, GCC 4.3."

From Tatsuhiro Nishioka, submissions posted by Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a modified ReaderWriterQT.cpp-file where I removed the support for rgb(a)-files. Quicktime supports only files with 3/4-channels rgba-files and not 1/2-channels rgb-files.This submission is from Tatsuhiro Nishioka, here's his original quote:

    When FlightGear crashes, the error message
    "GraphicsImportGetNaturalBounds failed" shows up. By adding printf
    debug, I found the error was -8969: codecBadDataErr when loading a
    gray-scaled (2 channels) rgba files even though the file can be loaded
    with Gimp and osgViewer properly.

    So I made an investigation on this problem and found an interesting
    thing. This error occurs only when non-rgb files are loaded before rgb
    files. The reason is that rgba files can be handled by both
    osgdb_rgb.so and osgdb_qt.so, but the error happens only when
    osgdb_qt.so try to load a gray-scaled rgba file.

    When a program is about to load an rgba file, osgdb_rgb.so is loaded
    and it handles the rgba file properly. In contrast, when a gray-scaled
    rgb file is being loaded after a non-rgb file (say png) is already
    loaded by osgdb_qt.so, osgdb_qt.so tries to load the file instead of
    osgdb_rgb, which causes the error above.

    Anyway, the bad thing is that QuickTime cannot handle gray-scaled rgb
    files properly. The solution for this is not to let osgdb_qt handle
    rgb files since osgdb_rgb can handle these properly.

From Chris Denham, " I think I may have discovered a bug in osgShadow/ShadowMap.cpp that results in incomplete shadows being generated. The problem seems to caused by an incorrect interpretation of the spot light cutoff angle. The valid ranges for spot cutoff are 0-90 and 180, i.e half the 'field of view' for the spotlight. Whereas the shadow map code seems to assume the the spot cutoff is equal to the field of view. This results in the shadows generated by the spotlight getting clipped at half the spot cutoff angle.I have fixed this in my copy of ShadowMap.cpp:
===============================
//Original code from OSG 2.6:
      if(selectLight->getSpotCutoff() < 180.0f)   // spotlight, then we don't need the bounding box
      {
          osg::Vec3 position(lightpos.x(), lightpos.y(), lightpos.z());
          float spotAngle = selectLight->getSpotCutoff();
          _camera->setProjectionMatrixAsPerspective(spotAngle, 1.0, 0.1, 1000.0);

_camera->setViewMatrixAsLookAt(position,position+lightDir,osg::Vec3(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f));
      }
===============================
// My modifications:
      float fov = selectLight->getSpotCutoff() * 2;
      if(fov < 180.0f)   // spotlight, then we don't need the bounding box
      {
          osg::Vec3 position(lightpos.x(), lightpos.y(), lightpos.z());
          _camera->setProjectionMatrixAsPerspective(fov, 1.0, 0.1, 1000.0);

_camera->setViewMatrixAsLookAt(position,position+lightDir,osg::Vec3(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f));
      }

This change seems correct for spot cutoff in the range 0, 90, but since OpenGL doesn't claim to support cutoffs >90 && <180, I'm not sure how shadow map should deal with those cases, but ignoring spot cut off greater than 90 here seems reasonable to me.

of platforms appending that "d" to their plugins. I have also updated the
CMakeLists.txt file to get "_DEBUG" defined at compilation time. I have
copied the already existent conditional block because of cmake's bizarre
operator precedence. Since Cygwin defines both CYGWIN and WIN32, the
following would suffice:

IF(CYGWIN OR UNIX AND NOT WIN32 AND NOT APPLE)

Sadly, it actually doesn't work, so I wrote a new conditional block just for
Cygwin. I could join the two blocks when the parentheses support is added in
newer versions of cmake."

From Adrian Egli, "i came around reviewing my code, and found now finally a solution to remove the polygon offset issue. as we all know the polygon offset has a different behaviour on different GPU system (ATI, NVidia) and this make the use of polygon offset complicate. so i looked for a solution to remove this offset.i changed the shader, also the filtering (default: on) use now a correct 3x3 filter:
 1 0 1
 0 2 0
 1 0 1

div: 6

of course a better one would be
 1 2 1
 2 4 2
 1 2 1

div: 16
but this isn't as performant as the simple filter above is. because we need only 5 texture lookups instead of 9, and the result is still good, if you wish we can add a enum to change the pcf filter type once, if there is a need.

From Christophe Loustaunau," I have found some errors on the example osgGeometryShaders. It's about the varying in the geometry shader. take a look at the varying vec4 v_color. In the vertex shader, v_color is initialized to gl_vertex then in the geometry shader v_color is initialized to gl_PositionIn[0] and in the fragment shader v_color is used as the fragment color.Try to initialized v_color to vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) in the vertex shader and comment the line :
"    v_color = v;\n"  in the geometry shader, and you will see the lines as black !

It's because you have to use keywords in and out.

extract from : http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/geometry_shader4.txt :

in - for function parameters passed into a function or for input varying
variables (geometry only)

out - for function parameters passed back out of a function, but not
initialized for use when passed in. Also for output varying variables
(geometry only).

Then for a geometry shader, a varying must be an array :
extract from : http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/geometry_shader4.txt :

Since a geometry shader operates on primitives, each input varying variable needs to be
declared as an array. Each element of such an array corresponds to a
vertex of the primitive being processed. If the varying variable is
declared as a scalar or matrix in the vertex shader, it will be a
one-dimensional array in the geometry shader. Each array can optionally
have a size declared. If a size is not specified, it inferred by the
linker and depends on the value of the input primitive type.


Here is a patch based on the svn version of osg that correct that.

From Max Bandazian, "Lines 302-305 of WindowManager.cpp seem to have a parenthesizing error - the code is             if(                 (!win || win->getVisibilityMode() == Window::VM_PARTIAL) &&                 !win->isPointerXYWithinVisible(x, y)             ) continue;But it probably should be

if (!win || (win->getVisibilityMode() == Window::VM_PARTIAL) && !win->isPointerXYWithinVisible(x, y)))
   continue;

The effect of the bug is to segfault if a non-osgWidgets::Window node hasn't been excluded from picking via NodeMask."

From Mathias Froehlich, "This is a generic optimization that does not depend on any cpu or instruction set.The optimization is based on the observation that matrix matrix multiplication
with a dense matrix 4x4 is 4^3 Operations whereas multiplication with a
transform, or scale matrix is only 4^2 operations. Which is a gain of a
*FACTOR*4* for these special cases.
The change implements these special cases, provides a unit test for these
implementation and converts uses of the expensiver dense matrix matrix
routine with the specialized versions.

Depending on the transform nodes in the scenegraph this change gives a
noticable improovement.
For example the osgforest code using the MatrixTransform is about 20% slower
than the same codepath using the PositionAttitudeTransform instead of the
MatrixTransform with this patch applied.

If I remember right, the sse type optimizations did *not* provide a factor 4
improovement. Also these changes are totally independent of any cpu or
instruction set architecture. So I would prefer to have this current kind of
change instead of some hand coded and cpu dependent assembly stuff. If we
need that hand tuned stuff, these can go on top of this changes which must
provide than hand optimized additional variants for the specialized versions
to give a even better result in the end.

An other change included here is a change to rotation matrix from quaterion
code. There is a sqrt call which couold be optimized away. Since we divide in
effect by sqrt(length)*sqrt(length) which is just length ...

Updated version number for 2.7.1 release, and added OSG_FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL Cmake option that enables the occlusion query workaround for an OpenGL driver crash

Mon, 25 Aug 2008 16:43:40 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Doug McCorkle, via Paul Martz who writes : "Summary: Some platforms/configurations cause application crashes if the occlusion query result is not ready for retrieval when the app tries to retrieve it. This fix adds an application-level wait loop to ensure the result is ready for retrieval. This code is not compiled by default; add "-D FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL" to get this code.Full, gory details, to the best of my recollection:

The conditions under which we encountered this issue are as follows: 64-bit
processor, Mac/Linux OS, multiple NVIDIA GPUs, multiple concurrent draw
threads, VRJuggler/SceneView-based viewer, and a scene graph containing
OcclusionQueryNodes. Todd wrote a small test program that produces an almost
instant crash in this environment. We verified the crash does not occur in a
similar environment with a 32-bit processor, but we have not yet tested on
Windows and have not yet tested with osgViewer.

The OpenGL spec states clearly that, if an occlusion query result is not yet
ready, an app can go ahead and attempt to retrieve it, and OpenGL will
simply block until the result is ready. Indeed, this is how
OcclusionQueryNode is written, and this has worked fine on several platforms
and configurations until Todd's test program.

By trial and error and dumb luck, we were able to workaround the crash by
inserting a wait loop that forces the app to only retrieve the query after
OpenGL says it is available. As this should not be required (OpenGL should
do this implicitly, and more efficiently), the wait loop code is not
compiled by default. Developers requiring this work around must explicitly
add "-D FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL" to the compile
options to include the wait loop."

From Sergey Leontyev, "1. In StyleManagerwhen applying styles to a Label element the code below runs in a infinite loop.

The reason for this is that nothing increments the Reader "r" in the case when applying a style to label,

so I advance the reader when no match was found. 

( To replicate the error apply style to any label)

 

replaced this:

                while(!r.eof()) if(_styles[style]->applyStyle(t, r)) inc = true;

 

with this:

                while(!r.eof())

                 {

                                if(_styles[style]->applyStyle(t, r))

                                    inc = true;

                                else

                                    r.advanceOverCurrentFieldOrBlock();

                 }            

 

 

I tested it and it works well for me, I did not find any problems with it.

 

 

2.  Added style support for Canvas element, event though there is no styles to apply yet.

It is usefull for someone who inherits from Canvas class to develop another element.

 If applyStyle(Canvas) does not exist

there is no way to apply style to the  element that inherited from Canvas element.

 

Added virtual

     bool applyStyle(Canvas).

 

and in added call to apply style if the Object is of type Canvas:

StyleManager::_applyStyleToObject(osg::Object* obj, const std::string& style) {

...

 

else if(!std::string("Canvas").compare(c))

return _coerceAndApply<Canvas>(obj,style,c);

From Erik van Dekker,"I made several modifications:

 

    * The cause of my errors was that my OSG source directory path contains spaces. To fix this issue I wrapped all paths with quotes, as stated in doxygen documentation.

 

    * I also received some warning messages about deprecated doxygen settings, which I fixed by updating the doxygen file, i.e. running \u2018doxygen \u2013u doxygen.cmake\u2018. By running this command deprecated doxygen options are removed, some option comments have changed and quite some options have been added (I kept their default settings unless mentioned).

 

    * I was surprised to find that the doxygen OUTPUT_DIRECTORY was set to \u201c${OpenSceneGraph_SOURCE_DIR}/doc\u201d, which does not seem appropriate for out of source builds; I changed this to \u201c${OpenSceneGraph_BINARY_DIR}/doc\u201d. (On the other hand, maybe a cmake selectable option should be given to the user?)

 

    * Fixed two warnings I received about unexpected end-of-list-markers in \u2018osg\AnimationPath and \u2018osgUtil\CullVisitor due to excess trailing points in comments.

 

    * Fixed a warning in osgWidget\StyleInterface due to an #include directive (strangely) placed inside a namespace.

 

    * Fixed a warning in osg\Camera due to the META_Object macro that confused doxygen. Adding a semi-colon fixed this.

 

    * Removed auto_Mainpage from the INCLUDE option, because I am positive that this file does not belong there; It never generated useful documentation anyway.

 

    * I added the OSG version number environment variable to the PROJECT_NUMBER option so that the version number is now shown on the main page of generated documentation (e.g. index.html).

 

    * Changed option FULL_PATH_NAMES to YES, but made sure STRIP_FROM_PATH stripped the absolute path until the include dir. This fixed an issue that created mangled names for identical filenames in different directories. E.g. osg/Export and osgDB/Export are now correctly named.

 

    * Changed option SHOW_DIRECTORIES to yes, which is a case of preference I guess.

From Maceij Krol, "I have implement frame based expiration of PagedLOD children.New attribute DatabasePager::_expiryFrames sets number of frames a PagedLOD child is kept in memory. The attribute is set with DatabasePager::setExpiryFrames method or OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES environmental variable.

New attribute PagedLOD::PerRangeData::_
frameNumber contains frame number of last cull traversal.

Children of PagedLOD are expired when time _AND_ number of frames since last cull traversal exceed OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY _AND_ OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES respectively. By default OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES = 1 which means that nodes from last cull/rendering
traversal will not be expired even if last cull time exceeds OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY. Setting OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES = 0 revokes previous behaviour of PagedLOD.

Setting OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES > 0 fixes problems of children reloading in lazy rendering applications. Required behaviour is achieved by manipulating OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY and OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES together.

Two interface changes are made:

DatabasePager::updateSceneGraph(double currentFrameTime) is replaced by DatabasePager::updateSceneGraph(const osg::FrameStamp &frameStamp). The previous method is in #if 0 clause in the header file. Robert, decide if You want to include it.

PagedLOD::removeExpiredChildren(double expiryTime, NodeList &removedChildren) is deprecated (warning is printed), when subclassing use PagedLOD::removeExpiredChildren(double expiryTime, int expiryFrame, NodeList &removedChildren) instead. "

From Jason Beverage, "I've got a few machines that OSG incorrectly believes support FRAME_BUFFER_OBJECTS so I am manually trying to set the renderTargetImplementation to PIXEL_BUFFER or PIXEL_BUFFER_RTT.  I noticed that this call wasn't setting the camera's overlay data properly because the setRenderTargetImplementation simply calls init() which only does anything for OBJECT_DEPENDENT_WITH_ORTHOGRAPHIC_OVERLAY.  Any subsequent calls to getOverlayData will simply return the cached OverlayData instead of setting it up.My fix updates the camera's render target implementation for all OverlayData objects in the OverlayDataMap."

From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Changes attached so that the CaptureOperation is passed in the constructor of the ScreenCaptureHandler (default 0 = default CaptureOperation). This way, you can do: viewer.addEventHandler(new osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler(
   new osgViewer::WriteToFileCaptureOperation("filename", "jpg")));

and the filename will be what you want. The WriteToFileCaptureOperation will add the context ID and the file number (if in SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER mode) to the file name.

(The attached also clarifies some notify messages, and corrects the comment when adding the handler in osgviewer.cpp)

I also remembered, the current architecture could allow a different CaptureOperation for each context, but currently the API only allows setting one CaptureOperation for all contexts. This could be improved if need be.

Author : Robert Osfield
From Doug McCorkle, "Attached is patch that corrects/improves the following issues with the OBJ loader:1. Added options to control wether the osgUtil::Tessellator or osgUtil::TriStripVisitor are run. By default they still run just as before.
2. Added support for the Emissive material. The data was being read from the mtl file but was never being applied to the model.
3. This is the main bug addressed, when a model is read in with an alpha value specified like:

newmtl Material__8
       Ns 24
       d 0.33
       illum 2
       Kd 0.204 0.204 0.204
       Ks 0 0 0
       Ka 0.153 0.153 0.153

where the alpha value is d. The loader would then overwrite the alpha value when reading the diffuse, specular, and ambient colors. I have changed all the material color readers to only set the values they read and to use the default colors specified in the constructor of the obj class. With these changes, the obj reader now handles opacity correctly if the alpha value is specified before the material colo"

From Mathias Froehlich, "Update to the configure check for msvc 7.1. MemoryBarrier() is used in the implementation, so it should be checked. This in effect disables the faster atomic ops on msvc 7.1 and older, even if only the MemoryBarrier() call is missing. But it ensures for the fist cut that it will build everywhere. If somebody cares for msvc 7.1 enough and has one for testing installed, he might provide the apropriate defines to guard that MemoryBarrier() call.I tested that msvc8 32/64bit still passes the configure tests and compiles.

Author : Robert Osfield
From Paul Martz, "The method IntersectionVisitor::apply(osg::PagedLOD&) appears to attempt to identify a "highest res" child of the PagedLOD and only allow intersection on that child. The implementation appears to be flawed in two cases:1) The "highest res" child is assumed to be the child with index "getNumFileNames()-1" or "getNumChildren()-1". As a result, PagedLODs that do not sort children from furthest to nearest will intersect with the wrong child. (see attached "case1.osg" to reproduce this problem.)
 
2) The code assumes there is only one highest res child. As a result. PagedLODs with multiple children at the same highest res range can only intersect one of those children. ("case2.osg" demonstrates this issue; you can only pick the quad on the right.)
 
I've attached a modified IntersectionVisitor.cpp that attempts to resolve these issues. It identifies a highest res range based on the range mode, then continues traversal on all valid children corresponding to that range description. Only in the case of a malformed PagedLOD does the code fall back to getting the last child in the list.

This way inlining and compiler optimization can no longer happen for these implementations, but it fixes compilation on win32 msvc targets. I expect that this is still faster than with with mutexes.Also the i386 gcc target gets atomic operations with this patch. By using an
implementation file we can guarantee that we have the right compiler flags
available."

From Neil Groves,"I have taken the liberty of updating a few files so that there is no longer any derivation from std::vector. I have done this by adding a new file osg/MixinVector and by updating only two others: osg/PrimitiveSet and osg/Array. You will notice that this actually removes what is acknowledged as a \u2018hack\u2019 in osg/PrimitiveSet.

With the original code I did manage to find memory leaks with some compiler options on VC 8 and 9, as well as Intel compiler. I determined the leak existence by instrumenting the destructor code, and by use of a garbage collector as a leak detector (in a similar manner to the Firefox project). Hence in contrast to what I said originally, it is exhibiting symptoms on at least some platforms.

Since I am trying to be a good OSG citizen I got out my editor and started hacking! I have built and tested on Linux (Ubuntu) with GCC 4.x and Windows VC 8 SP1. It appears that nothing is broken, and that I\u2019m using less memory J"

From Rudolf Weidemann, "in the OpenFlight format materials can have editable names. In the OSG OpenFlight plugin these names are ignored when reading, and empty strings are written.As we need these names in the OSG scene graph by our application, I
changed the plugin code, so the names are now stored in class
"osg::Material" (derived from "osg::Object") by
 material->setName();
(see "PaletteRecords.cpp, line 195) when reading the file, and written
to file by
 dos.writeString( m.Material->getName(), 12 );
(see MaterialPaletteManager.cpp, line 80).

As these names otherwise get lost when reading an OpenFlight file and
writing it again e.g. by
 osgconv example.flt converted_example.flt
these changes make the plugin more complete.

The changes were made to OSG revision 8425, and were tested by
 osgconv example.flt converted_example.flt
comparing the material palettes of both files inside Multigen Creator."

From Farshid Lashkari, "I noticed some problems when setting up CameraNodes that inherit viewport settings in stereo mode. It seems that the SceneView::cull() method will pass the full size viewport to the left/right cullvisitors, instead of the modified stereo viewport. I made quite a few changes to SceneView to fix the issue. The SceneView::cullStage() method will now receive the viewport as an argument, instead of using the global viewport. The SceneView::cull() method will pass the modifed viewport to cullStage when rendering in stereo.There are 2 new private methods computeLeftEyeViewport() and
computeRightEyeViewport() that will compute the stereo viewports. I
also modified the draw() function so it applies the correct viewport
to the prerender stages. These changes are only necessary for
horizontal/vertical split stereo."

From Paul Melis, "Here is a reworked version of the osgviewerWX example. It changes the GraphicsWindowWX to only inherit from osgViewer::GraphicsWindow and adds a standalone widget, called OSGCanvas, that derives from wxGLCanvas. This solves a problem with the GraphicsWindowWX instance being destructed twice (see "Crash in osgviewerWX" of June 12th on osg-users). At program exit, the main frame deletes all of its children widgets and therefore calls GraphicsWindowWX's destructor, bypassing OSG's reference counting. The GraphicsWindowWX instance is then later destructed a second time when the reference held by osg::Camera goes to zero. This bug isn't exposed by the example directly, but if people are going to use the example as a basis (like the poster in the mentioned thread) they very likely will run into this problem. "

Since the type was copied from rhs, it should create the same array as rhs has, so then it should copy the data in the following lines.

I discovered that if the visitor is unable (for any reason) to load a subtile via the ReadCallback, the intersection fails. However, I had the requirement to "fall back" on the lower-resolution parent tile and settle for that intersection.This was easy to implement simply by overriding IntersectionVisitor::apply(PagedLOD). My question is: Are there any opinions on whether this should be the default behavior? If it makes sense, I will submit the change; if not, no worries."

This can happen in circumstances that are not manageable by the OSG itself (e.g. 3rd party buggy program) but one would expect the plugin to be able to recover by returning ReadResult::ERROR_IN_READING_FILE.libpng provides two callbacks for warnings and errors - those are
currently unused. By default, they point to function that call exit()
or something similar (the default error callback never returns). This
patch registers the callbacks using libpng's mechanisms, makes the
warning callback emit an osg::notify(osg::WARN) message and the error
callback throw an error. The reading process is enclosed in a
try...catch block. Upon error, the memory is freed and
ReadResult::ERROR_IN_READING_FILE is returned.

From Michael Platings, "Yes it's definitely a driver problem - I submitted a bug report to nvidia 6 months ago and the issue is still "in progress". I've given up waiting for them!Platform - various Intel Windows XP SP2 PCs with various nvidia cards
including GeForce 8800 GTS and Quadro FX 4500, and various driver
versions including the latest WHQL 175.16.

I investigated your concerns about glGenerateMipmapEXT being slower than
GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS, and for power-of-two textures, to my surprise
it is. For a 512*512 texture, glGenerateMipmapEXT takes on average 10ms,
while GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS takes on average 6ms. Therefore I have
modified the code to only use glGenerateMipmapEXT if the texture has a
non-power-of-two width or height. I am resubmitting all the files
previously submitted (only "Texture.cpp" has significant changes since
my previous submission, I've also replaced tabs with spaces in

From Michael Platings, "On nvidia cards mipmap generation for non-power-of-two textures with GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS is very slow (over half a second for a 720*576 texture). However, glGenerateMipmapEXT() performs well (16ms for the same texture), so I have modified the attached files to use Texture::generateMipmap() if glGenerateMipmapEXT is supported, instead of enabling & disabling GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS."Notes, from Robert Osfield, I've tested the out of the previous path using
GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS and non power of two textures on NVidia 7800GT and
Nvidia linux drivers with the image size 720x576 and only get compile times
of 56ms, so the above half second speed looks to be a driver bug.  With
Muchael's changes the cost goes done to less than 5ms, so it's certainly 
an effective change, even given that Michael's poor expereiences with
GL_GENERATE_MIP_SGIS do look to be a driver bug.

From Brad Anderegg, "This submission fixes two bugs and helps some performance problems we have been having with txp databases.The first bug is that the terrain tiles will page out to a lower LOD when they are right in front of you.  The issue appears to be with the blacklisting heuristic which forces a tile to LOD 1, commenting out the usage of blacklisting with the LOD Nodes fixes our problem.  This code change was made to line 29 of TXPPageLOD.cpp.

 

The second bug we were experiencing is that the database reader options never make it through to the archive loader.  The use case for us appeared when the FID codes for the terrain were no longer on the materials.  As it turns out the archive was being created twice, once by TXPNode and once by the ReaderWriterTXP on getArchive() so the options never actually got set on the archive that was being loaded.  The fix is to first create the archive by calling getArchive on the ReaderWriterTXP, which stores it in a map for reference later, and then passing that archive into the TXPNode for it to set its internal member.  With this code change we only create one archive (not sure what creating two did) and our options flags get set properly on the database.

 

The changes made are in TXPNode.h line 72 where the TXPArchive is now passed in.  In the TXPNode.cpp the loadArchive(TXPArchive*) was changed to have the default behavior if NULL is passed in, if an archive is passed in then it does not load it since all the loading is done in the ReaderWriterTXP::getArchive().  The only other place that loadArchive is called is in TXPIO.cpp where a modification was made to pass in NULL which will have the same behavior as it used to.  The last change is the little block of code starting on line 57 of ReaderWriterTXP.cpp, this was changed so that it first calls getArchive() which caches the archives in a map does some loading stuff and returns a pointer to it which is then passed in as a parameter to TXPNode::loadArchive().

 

The performance changes were made to TXPParser.cpp line 163 where we use to osgUtil::Optimizer on the node before passing it off, and on line 1456 we changed the geometry to use display lists.  These small changes actually made drastic performance increases for us, as much as 1000% on certain laptops.

 

As far as testing goes, we have tested these changes with at least 5 txp databases on a variety of different computers including Mac OS and Linux.  The base version used is 2.4."

Updated version numbers in prep for 2.5.1 release

Tue, 27 May 2008 12:06:50 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Gino van den Bergen, "I've refactored the single ReadedWriterVRML2.cpp into multiple files. The reason for doing this was to break up the horribly long functionosg::ref_ptr<osg::Node> ReaderWriterVRML2::convertFromVRML(openvrml::node *obj)
 
The fixes are:
 
* Added the source's parent directory as search directory for image files.
* The material properties are now set in the stateset of the Geode rather than the Geometry. This will allow geometries to be reused with different material properties in future updates.
 
NB: I planned for a caching scheme in which multiple occurences of the same primitive (e.g., Cylinders with radius 0.8 and height 1.2), would use the same Geometry object. Unfortunately, my planning moved me to other areas, but I might still finish the caching scheme in a quiet hour. For the time being I decided it would be a good thing to already submit my current changes.

From Stephane Lamoliatte, "Here is a patch that fix the strange bug describe on the osg-user group. Finally it seems to not come from the empty geode. The origin of the problem seems to be the uniform initialization during the building of the program which call a glUseProgram. If your scene never display the node that contains the shader and if there is no other shader on the scene, this "glUseProgram" is the only one that is called during your simulation. So, this shader is applied on all the scene.I fix this bug by switching off the shader (by calling glUseProgram(0) ) during the compilation of a state which does not contain the shader.

Author : Robert Osfield
From Wang Rui, "I have just done some changes on the classic osgdb_gif plugin (based on OSG 2.5.0). I wish our developers may use the newly written GIF reading plugin to attach animate GIF files as textures now! In my opinion, a GIF is much smaller than AVI and MOVs, and much more efficient sometimes.Changes includes:
1. A new GifImageStream class (inherit from osg::ImageStream and OpenThreads::Thread) have already been added to implement different operations of a GIF movie, such like playing, pausing, rewinding, setting time and so on.
2. Some small changes to decode_row() and gif_read_stream(), which make the transparency of GIF images correctly.
3. Just a few changes to the ReaderWriterGIF::readGIFStream() function, which ensure that animate GIFs are loaded by GifImageStream (and the function returns GifImageStream objects) and static GIFs unchanged (still use the old method and returns osg::Image objects!).
 
Attachments are the cpp file and an animate GIF file for further test. Just rebuild the osgdb_gif project and use osgviewer or osgmovie to view it.
The plugin has been tested on Windows and Arch Linux."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Philip Lowman, post 1:"Here is a collection of changes which should fix issues building the OSG with CMake 2.6.0 (along with some other changes)

CMakeLists.txt:
* Set CMP0003 to supress warning about linking against -lpthread (which is a
  non-absolute library location).  (CMake 2.6.x fix)
* Modified the WIN32_USE_MP and a couple of other Visual Studio specific flags
  to be in an IF(MSVC) block  (minor tweak to reduce exposing this stuff on MinGW builds)
* Includes my second set of glu tesselator autodetection changes that you
seemed to want but haven't committed yet.

src/OpenThreads/pthreads/CMakeLists.txt:
* Eliminates warning when compiling on Linux about spaces in link line (CMake 2.6.x fix)

CMakeModules/OsgMacroUtils.cmake:
* Tweaks to make the macros behave properly under CMake 2.6.0 (doesn't change behavior under CMake 2.4.x)

CMakeModules/Find3rdPartyDependencies.cmake:
* Adds the NO_DEFAULT_PATH option to all of the search options so that things in C:\Program Files\OpenSceneGraph aren't accidently picked up during configure time and instead only things in the "3rdParty" folder are discovered. (general bugfix)
"

post 2:
"Ok, hold the presses.  I just discovered that for some odd reason the osgdb_* plugins under Linux aren't getting put under the osgPlugins-2.5.0 folder.  Not exactly sure why this broke, the folder was there, just empty.  I'll have to look into it this evening."

post 3:

"Fixed, was caused by the switch to CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY and some code in osgPlugins/CMakeLists.txt that effectively overrides LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH on non-MSVC compilers to dump the plugins in the plugins folder.  I tweaked it to override CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY as well.  Seems to work fine."

From Paul Martz, "When exporting a DrawArrays PrimitiveSet, the DAE plugin computes an incorrect nbVerticesPerPoly if the first index is not zero. The issue can be reproduced easily with:   osgconv cessna.osg cessna.daeExamination of the resulting .dae file reveals several out-of-range tristrip indices; viewing the .dae file in osgviewer causes a crash when OSG tries to lookup those indices.
 
Attached resolves this issue."

From Gino, "According to the 1.4.1 COLLADA spec (2nd ed) the standard behavior for fx_sampler_wrap_common is as followsCLAMP ->GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE
NONE->GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER

The current 2.5.0 daePlugin assumes the following binding

CLAMP ->GL_CLAMP
NONE->GL_REPEAT

Notably the GL_CLAMP binding will result in visible black seams on input files that use otherwise matching textures. Replacing GL_CLAMP by GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE solves this problem. I've updated both the read and write functions.

From Paul Melis, "Here is an update to the osgviewerWX example. Keyboard events were not always received because the GraphicsWindowWX wasn't receiving focus. It now receives focus when the mouse enters the window. * I split the mouse handling from a monolithic method to separate ones, slightly cleaner than a whole bunch of if()'s, especially with another case of the mouse entering the canvas. * I changed the EVT_KEY_DOWN handler to an EVT_CHAR handler, although that now makes the up and down handler assymetric. The new down-handler returns translated key codes, so when you press the S key (without anything else), it actually returns 's' and not 'S' as the EVT_KEY_DOWN did. This means that statistics can be called up in the viewer window, while the example previously only printed a "Stats output:" line to the console. I'm not truly happy that the up handler returns _untranslated_ key codes. But solving this completely would probably mean adding some table that translated from wxWidgets' untranslated key codes to OSG's internal ones. This might be interesting to add, as anyone using OSG + wxWidgets in any serious manner would also have to add this. * I commented out the evt.Skip()'s in the keyboard handlers as these would only be necessary if there were some key events that are not handled. But currently all key events are simply forwarded. * I changed the handling of a mouse drag to a more general mouse move"

Refactored DatabasePager and related classes to introduce support for multi-threaded paging, where the Pager manages threads of reading local and http files via seperate threads.  This makes it possible to smoothly browse large databases where parts of the data are locally cached while others are on a remote server.  Previously with this type of dataset the pager would stall all paging while http requests were being served, even when parts of the models are still loadable virtue of being in the local cache.Also as part of the refactoring the DatabaseRequest are now stored in the
ProxyNode/PagedLOD nodes to facilitate quite updating in the cull traversal,
with the new code avoiding mutex locks and searches.  Previous on big 
databases the overhead involved in make database requests could accumulate
to a point where it'd cause the cull traversal to break frame.  The overhead
now is negligable.

Finally OSG_FILE_CACHE support has been moved from the curl plugin into
the DatabasePager.  Eventually this functionality will be moved out into
osgDB for more general usage.

From Melchior Franz, "In KDE I switch desktops with Super-Tab, and occasionally I get an excess Tab key report when switching back to an OSG application (usually FlightGear :-). Although KDE has consumed the Tab, it's sometimes still in the XKeymapEvent's key_vector, and followed by a Tab KeyRelease event.Avoid this artifact by
- asking for a "fresh" keymap (via XQueryKeymap()), rather than
 using the unreliable(?) XKeymapEvent's key_vector, and by
- flushing all key events on focus-in (to avoid the KeyRelease)

After Super-press, Tab-press, Super-release, Tab-release (note
the wrong release order!) I still get an extra Tab event. But
this is not surprising and not exactly wrong either. Also it's
hard to avoid, as we can't see what happened to the keyboard
before we regained focus.

From Paul Martz, "As I discovered prior to the 2.4 release, the FLT export geometry backend was using some old turn-on code, originally written just to enable other development but not intended for actual release. Sadly, my OSG training commitments prevented me from fixing this prior to 2.4.In essence, the FLT exporter was emitting a full set of Mesh records each time it encountered a PrimitiveSet.
 
Attached is a fix. The code now emits the Mesh set up records, then iterates over all PrimitiveSets and emits a Mesh Primitive record per PrimitiveSet.
 
It also loops over PrimitiveSets twice, first writing Face records according to the mode, the writing Mesh records (again according to the mode).
 
The final change included here is support for GL_POINTS as single-vertex Face records.
 
Billboards are still to come."

From Stephan Huber, "attached you'll find a refactored and improved quicktime-plugin. I moved all code related to the image-loading, swizzling etc into an extra class. The quicktime plugin supports now reading and writing images from/to streams and the code is less cluttered than previous versions.I removed QTtexture.h/.cpp and added QTImportExport.h/.cpp. I updated the CMake-files, I hope they are alright. I used the submitted code in my own apps since two months or so and it seems pretty stable, but as always the migration to the osg-quicktime plugin may have introduced new bugs, so perfect for developer release :)"

From Bob Kuehne, "he attached are conversions of the 3 main places i found in osg where tokens are used to represent bitmasks with 'magic' numbers, like 32. i've changed these to a more representative bitshift representation, showing clearly in which bit you can expect this token to manifest. ie, converted things like:from:            DEEP_COPY_STATESETS         = 8,
to:              DEEP_COPY_STATESETS         = 1<<3,

showing clearly that this isn't the _value_ 8, but the _bit_ 8. this is an old pattern i see (and like to promulgate) to make code a bit more readable and maintainable.

Author : Robert Osfield
From Melchior Franz, "The GUIEventAdapter header file had KeySymbols for the super and hyper keys defined already, but these modifiers were missing in GUIEventAdapter::ModKeyMask, and the EventQueue ingored them as well.The attached diff/archive adds the missing parts for Super/Hyper
modifier key support.


I'm aware that this might not be supported on all systems/keyboards
out of the box, but decided to submit it anyway because:

- developers are aware of differences between input devices
 (Some mice have scroll wheels, others don't. Some have five or
 more buttons, some have only one. Some keyboards don't have
 numpads, some have AltGr, some don't etc.)

- even if someone relies on Hyper/Super in distributed software,
 this is easy to fix and doesn't create lock-in conditions

- while the names Hyper/Super may only be common on X11, they are
 just symbol names and not OS-specific

- even though some systems might not offer these additional modifiers
 by default, it's likely that all of them have at least 8 modifier
 levels internally, so it should only be a matter of OS configuration
 to make them work

- having super/hyper available is useful to offer a user ways
 to define local key definitions that are safe from collisions with
 predefined "official" key assignments"

Author : Robert Osfield
From Sherman Wilcox, "Modified the cmakelists.txt file for the curl plugin so the proper linker directories are set in Win32. The old cmakelists.txt would set the lib release folder for debug builds as well. This should correct that."

From Benoit Laniel, "I use mingw to cross-compile openscenegraph to win32. However, linux filesystem is case-sensitive. Here are the modifications needed to make the compiler happy. These are only some include lines rewritten (Io.h to io.h, Windows.h to windows.h etc.) for version 2.3.7."

Fri, 11 Apr 2008 10:16:38 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Bob Kuehne, "1) add simplifier command "--simplifier .5" to reduce complexity 2) complementarily add a "--overallNormal" to replace per-vert/per-facet normals with an overall. simplifier doesn't work   in certain cases without less complex normals. this gets that done. 3) add env var output with full verbose output so people realize it's active when the app is run - i see this all the time in training where people run osgconv, with unintended data transformations due to osgUtil:;Optimzer, for example"

Fri, 11 Apr 2008 10:10:40 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
Added --mouse option to enable mouse tracking, and fixed bug in assumption that nv is not null.

Thu, 3 Apr 2008 18:36:50 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
Introduced CMake build option for compiling double or float versions of osg::BoundingSphere and osg::BoundingBox.Introduced code in BoundgingSphere, BoundingBox, ProxyNode and LOD to utilise the above settings.

Added Matrix::value_type, Plane::value_type, BoundingSphere::value_type and BoundingBox::value_type command line 
options that report where the types of floats or doubles.

Author : Robert Osfield
From Colin McDonald, "The X11WindowingSystemInterface in osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp unconditionally sets the X11 error handler routine, replacing anything that was previously set.  This is a bit unfriendly, as the X11 error handler is a global attribute which the application, or the GUI toolkit being used, may well have set itself.So I have modified X11WindowingSystemInterface to only replace the error
handler if it is the default i.e. if the application has not set it."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Mattias Helsing, "While using the dds plugin (via osgdem) it was able to write 24bit images with BGR order but not read them. My 2-liner fixed it for me but it may be that someone with more knowledge of the plugin want to insert more pixel formats in the reading part of the plugin."

Wed, 2 Apr 2008 13:57:26 +0000

From Mattias Helsing, "Subject: osga reading slash mismatch requests for files in a archive are made with unix style paths. So to be able to match an entry in map(_indexMap) it's keys needs to be stored in unix style even on Win32"Note from Robert Osfied, simplified this submission so that the added conversion to
unix slahes is done on all platforms as this should be safe and simpler to maintain.

Fri, 28 Mar 2008 15:52:10 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
Rewrote the DatabasePager::removeExpiredSubgraphs(double) routine as it as not expiring subgraphs quick enough to enable reasonable load balancing.New version isn't perfect and will need further work, but does at least reduce
the memory footprint by as much as half on test paths on big databases.

The rewritten method no longer uses the the MaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs
and MinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs variables so these and associated methods
for accessing them have been removed.

-        /** Set the maximum number of PagedLOD child to remove per frame */
-        void setMaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs(unsigned int number) { _maximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs = number; }
-
-        /** Get the maximum number of PagedLOD child to remove per frame */
-        unsigned int getMaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs() const { return _maximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs; }
-
-        /** Set the minimum number of inactive PagedLOD child to keep */
-        void setMinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs(unsigned int number) { _minimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs = number; }
-
-        /** Get the minimum number of inactive PagedLOD child to keep */
-        unsigned int getMinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs() const { return _minimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs; }

From Paul Martz, "Here's the mods to the OpenFlight plugin to support FLT export. The ZIP file contains the new .cpp/h files as well as existing files that I modified.Changes to existing files:
  ReaderWriter.cpp -- to support writeNode() of course.
  ReaderWriterATTR.cpp -- to support writeObject -- we write .attr files for textures, if they don't already exist.
  AttrData.cpp/.h -- Minor fixes.
  CMakeLists.txt -- to include the new files in the build."
  
From Robert Osfield, port to non Windows platforms just required fixing of header capitilization errors
that windows lets through the net due to having a case insensitive file system.

From Melchoir Franz, "osgViewer toggled the NumLock state correctly when pressing the NumLock key, but it didn't pick up the initial state. So, if NumLock was on for the OS at startup (LED on), it was still off for OSG. And the first keypress turned the LED off, and NumLock on for OSG. The attached fix picks up the state on every FocusIn, just like it was done in the last commits for CapsLock. The difference is, that the NumLock mask isn't standardized (e.g. 0x10 for Linux, and 0x80 for AIX), so we have to do a reverse lookup (::rescanModifierMapping()).Note that I could not reproduce the problem on my system, but someone
else confirmed it twice on his, and the patch fixed it for him.

Changed files:

From Gino van den Bergen, "I've added a few fixes to the VRML 2.0 plugin:1) Full DOS paths are now correctly opened by OpenVRML. A URL containing
a DOS path should be "file:///C:data/blah" rather than "file://C:data/blah".

2)  The last primitive defined in "coordIndex" is now added if the
"coordIndex" is not terminated by -1.

3) Smoothed normals are computed if no normal field is provided.
Currently, there is no support for "creaseAngle", so all edges (even the
ones sharper than the creaseAngle) are smoothed. I might add this in the
future if demand rises.

4) If an IndexedFaceSet contains only triangles or quads then the
primitive type is set to TRIANGLES or QUADS, and the primset becomes
DrawArrays rather than DrawArrayLengths.

Question: I noticed that for DrawArrays you can still provide an index
array. Would the rendering be faster if I'd create DrawElements primsets
rather than DrawArrays? Phrased differently, what is the benefit of
using DrawElements over DrawArrays, as there is clearly not a one-to-one
mapping of these concepts to their OpenGL counterparts?

5) Objects are added to the transparent bin and blend mode is enabled
only if the transparency is nonzero. Rendered transparent objects no
longer write the depth buffer."

It now takes a model file as command-line argument (complaining if there isn't one), and its startup window size is now actually applied (it used to be too small). I tested this with a unicode-build of wxWidgets, as that is the recommended build type on Linux with GTK. I'm pretty sure this version of the example will work for the ANSI build as well, but I have no way of testing."

From Melchoir Franz, "ac3d.cpp does currently strip everything but the file name in "texture" paths. This is to drop absolute paths that some 3d editors export (even AC3D itself!). But this also strips directories of relative paths, which is wrong and contradicts the ac3d reference implementation. (The reference implementation doesn't strip anything, though, and so takes the absolute paths as they are. Definitely not what we want.)The attached solution checks absolute paths and only strips
those:

 (1)  A:\\foo\\bar.png   ->   bar.png            (as before)
 (2)  /foo/bar.png       ->   bar.png            (as before)

 (3)  foo/bar.png        ->   foo/bar.png        (new)
 (4)  ../foo/bar.png     ->   ../foo/bar.png     (new)

I have attached a modified osgpick.cpp so you can test it out quickly (please don't check this file in though :-) ) The eventState is then incorrect and picking does not work.

Author : Robert Osfield
From Colin McDonald, "Attached is an updated to osgViewer::PixelBufferWin32.The win32 pbuffer implementation returned an error unless both the
WGL_ARB_pbuffer and the WGL_ARB_render_texture functions were present.
This was too restrictive, as a pbuffer can usefully be created without
render-to-texture, e.g. for use with glReadPixels.  The osg 1.2/Producer
pbuffers worked without RTT, and osgUtil::RenderStage has all the code to
handle both RTT and non-RTT pbuffers, doing a read and copy in the
latter case.

With these changes I have successfully tested the osgprerender example
on a graphics card which supports RTT, and one which doesn't.  Plus
tested in my own application.

In order to aid diagnostics I have also added more function status
return checks, and associated error messages.  I have included the win32
error text in all error messages output.  And there were some errors
with multi-threaded handling of "bind to texture" and a temporary window
context which I have corrected.

These is one (pre-existing) problem with multi-threaded use of pbuffers
in osgViewer & osgprerender, which I have not been able to fix.  A win32
device context (HDC) can only be destroyed from the thread that created
it.  The pbuffers for pre-render cameras are created in
osgUtil::RenderStage::runCameraSetUp, from the draw thread.  But
closeImplementation is normally invoked from the destructor in the main
application thread.  With the additional error messages I have added,
osgprerender will now output a couple of warnings from
osgViewer::PixelBufferWin32::closeImplementation() at exit, after
running multi-threaded on windows.  I think that is a good thing, to
highlight the problem.  I looked into fixing it in osgViewer::Renderer &
osgUtil::RenderStage, but it was too involved for me.  My own
application requirements are only single-threaded.

Unrelated fix - an uninitialised variable in
osg::GraphicsThread::FlushDeletedGLObjectsOperation().

From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Attached is modified osgShadow::ShadowMap. I changed following things:1:
Shadow map camera sets ABSOLUTE_RF_INHERIT_VIEWPOINT refernce frame. 
 
2:
Light Direction  by matrix multiplications replaced with transform3x3 multiplication.
 
3:
I made DebugingHUD functional by adding special draw callback. Former version was simply drawing pale square. 
 
4:
I was tempted to make 4 th change but decided to not do it. Instead I put it whith #if VIEW_DEPNDENT_TEXGEN. If you decide you may let it go.
 
When objects are not centered at 0,0,0 coord but in some distant location (for example at surface of earth ellipsoid) shadow texgen suffers from inadequate precision of float matrices. I changed that by premultiplying Texgen matrix (using OSG double matrices) with inverse modelview and applying it later with ModelView identity matrix. This tweak may be appropriate for OverlayNode texgen as well.
 
I left former version because I suspect that this change will make osgShadow::ShadowMap view dependant. Currently texgen matrix remains the same no matter what View displays it. With my change it wuld be different for each view. This touches the subject of View Dependent Shadow Techniques that J-S asked recently."

FrameBufferAttachment::FrameBufferAttachment(Texture3D*

From Melchior Franz, fixed handling of modified keys when entering/leaving window

Mon, 25 Feb 2008 16:50:28 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Franz Melchior, "When switching virtual desktops or minimizing a window, keys remain in pressed state after revealing, even if they are no longer pressed on the keyboard. This can have bad effects, especially if the stuck keys are modifier keys. One has to press and release the stuck keys again to reset the wrong state.The fix keeps track of all key presses and releases. On FocusOut
and UnmapNotify it releases all keys that are in pressed state,
and on KeymapNotify (following a FocusIn), it sets the currently
pressed keys again. To avoid confusion in the OSG-using application
normal keys are always reported released /before/ and pressed
/after/ modifier keys.

As current key states are returned as char[32] keymap by
XQueryKeymap and XKeymapEvent, this format is also used to
recognize modifier keys and for maintaining the current
internal key state. Functions to set/clear/query bits in
such a keymap are added.

The patch was extensively tested with osgkeyboard and
FlightGear under KDE and fvwm2. It was not tested on a
Xinerama setup or with multiple windows, but as _eventDisplay
is used throughout, there should be no problems. The patch also
makes the following changes:

- removes old and obsolete handling of modifier keys in ::adaptKey().
 This wasn't only unused, but also wrong (and for that reason commented
 out in revision 7066). The modifier states are actually handled
 in ./src/osgGA/EventQueue.cpp (EventQueue::keyPress/keyRelease).
- fixes some spelling"

From Emmanuel Roche, "I'm joining two zip files to this mail for the modified sources and include files of osgIntrospection.The modifications I made are very small but they are absolutely usefull to use osgIntrospection with visual studio 7.1 or 8 in debug modes.
This should also solve other minor common problems (converter memory leak, virtual destructor for PropertyInfo, etc...).

I choosed two function names : Reflection::uninitialize() and Type::reset(), this can of course be changed if someone has a better idea...

I made the changes against OSG 2.2.0 public release. I tested the result with VS 7.1, VS 7.1 SP1, VS 8.0 SP1 and AQTime 5.0 on Windows XP SP2... All 4 seem to agree : they detected memory leaks before and don't anymore.

Sorry I haven't take the time to test that on linux but the changes are so small I doubt there could be a problem... I let you check that on your side  :-).

I hope this will help making OSG an even more wonderfull library."

From Wojciech Lewandowski, "----1----Attached is a fixed version of OverlayNode.cpp. I fixed CustomPolytope::cut( osg::Plane ) method.  Bug was apparent in such scenario:
 
Let P1 be some random frustum polytope
Let P2 be the polytope that was created from P1 bounding box (P2 contains P1 entirely)
 
Then ignoring precision errors: P1.cut( P2 ) == P2.cut( P1 ) == P1.  But this condition was not always met. Cut failed when some of the polytope reference points happened to lie exactly on some intersecting planes in both P1 & P2  (plane distance was = 0).
 
I only use CustomPolytope for my shadowing stuff so I did not test how this affects rest of OverlayNode.cpp.
 
----2----
 
Also attached is a minor precision improvement for osg::Plane intersect method (double version). 
 
----3----
 
I have also one observation regarding osg::Plane - There are two intersect vertices methods (float and double flavour):
 
inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3>& vertices) const
inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3d>& vertices) const
 
I guess osg::Plane won't compile when someone changes default vec3 typedef to vec3d. Shouldn't the first method be changed to use vec3f explicitly ? Ie:
 
inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3f>& vertices) const"

From Rene Molenaar, "Using commandline build system nmake on windows does not work.This is caused by the OSG_MSVC_VERSIONED_DLL hack.
there are hard-coded paths to place the dll's in the bin /dir that normally would go
in the lib/config (release/debug) dirs. Nmake has different locations for the files (no config dir).
 
 fix: change the macro's in OsgMacroUtils.cmake for the IF(NOT MSVC_IDE) situation.
 Libs go in lib/, and DLLs and executables go in bin/
 To accopmplish this for MSVC_IDE the targets get a "../../bin" prefix,
 for nmake this should be "../bin" (because there are no config folders).

 This fix mimics the behaviour of the MSCV_IDE (visual studio) build system when building with nmake.
 
 Note:
 A change in the main CMakeLists.txt creates the needed plugin directory in the binary dir.
 
 see included files for the changes:
 r7885fix-v2/CMakeModules/OsgMacroUtils.cmake  
 r7885fix-v2/osgWrappers/CMakeLists.txt

From Thibault Genessay, "On Dec 16 you introduced a fix to remove internal use of ref_ptr<>'s. It contained a bug that would cause freed memory to be written again. Specifically, in FreeTypeLibrary::~FreeTypeLibrary(), calling font->setImplementation(0); deletes the content pointed to by the fontImplementation pointer, while the line the immediately follows tries to access it.My fix is to make the second instruction part of an else clause rather
than always executed. This way, the fontImplementation->_facade = 0
instruction is only executed when the font implementation is not set
to 0 before (although I have no idea what it is here for and if this
code path is ever followed, since I don't know the plugin's internals
very well).

Attached is the modified FreeTypeLibrary.cpp file."

From Eric Wing, "Attached are a few Find modules with updates. Among other things, they contain better support for environmental variables to pre-empt the autodection default search path order which is very helpful for people who do automated builds. (I recommend that the remaining modules consider adding the same system to make things consistent and easier for those people that want to do the automated builds.)The CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH has also been added to help people. I don't
recommend adding this to the other modules because it looks like CMake
agreed with my idea and will be adding the support in 2.6. So when
that ships, people will get it for free. (In the meantime, my modules
that do have it, it can be used.)

Finally, I've submitted all of these modules to official CMake plus
more so they will be in the next version of CMake. It looks like I may
need to sort some compatibility issues out with the KDE people who
seem to have conflicting modules, but this is unrelated to the updates
submitted here as OSG already has these conflicts. I figured I would
just sync OSG up with my current/best versions.

Also of note, I added the large batch of Findosg*.cmake modules to
CMake so people building against OpenSceneGraph can use these without
writing their own. I wasn't sure if I should submit them here or not
since they are for building against OSG and not for building OSG
itself. So they are not included.

From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "When using osg::Sequence you can stop the sequence by setting the mode to STOP. Subsequently, you can restart it from the beginning by setting the mode to START. This does not work as expected. The _now time is not updated while the mode is STOP, which causes the items in the sequence to flash by very quickly when the mode is set to START.For example, if the mode was set to STOP and left that way for 30
seconds, and there are 10 items in the sequence, when the mode is set
to START all the items will flash by (in 3 loops) while the _now time
catches up with the real time, and then the sequence will go on at the
rate it should.

This is a simple fix for that, which updates the _now time regardless
of the mode the sequence is in."

From Wojciech Lewandowski, "By complete coincidence I just have read an old OSG submission mail related to bugfixes in osg::Polytope.setToUnitFrustum and setToBoundingBox  It was sent at beginning of december. I read it when purging my Thrash emails and found it there this because it was wrongly classified as SPAM.What stroke me in this email was the fact that there was once an error in
Polytope class. Since I adopted CustomPolytope (osgSim OverlayNode.cpp) for
my minimal shadow area computations I checked my code for this error. And I
found it in CustomPolytope::setToUnitFrustum method.
CustomPolytope::setToBoundingBox seemed OK.

So I went back to the origin and fixed this error in OverlayNode.cpp as
well. I have not tested it in OverlayNode though (I don't know how) so
please look at this carefully. But it seems to work fine with my shadow
calculations."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Wojiech Leandowski, "I earlier wrote about my hassles with archives under Windows. I implemented 64 bit binary compatible OSGA archive reader/writer using mixed stdio/iostream calls. But during this work I learned that it can be made in much simpler way.Attached is result of this new attempt. I hope its appropriate for inclusion
into OSG codebase. It was compiled and tested with latest SVN OSG, Windows
XP 32 bit and Windows Vista business 64 bit. OSG was built using VS 2005
Express SP1 for 32 bit environment and VS 2005 Std for 64 bit.
---
Solution description (there were two problems involved):
---
Problem 1: implicit conversions beetween file positions and 32 bit int. This
could be considered a MS compiler bug because this 32 bit int was
additionally implicitly converted to/from 64 bit. As far as I know compiler
is allowed to make only one implict conversion (but maybe this rule does not
refer to simple types).

Its actually possible to address OSGA files above 4 GiB range using 32 bit
windows iostreams. MS Iostreams in practice offer the same level of
functionality as stdio functions. There are functions fsetpos and fgetpos in
stdio lib which use 64 bit file pointers (fpos_t). These functions are
internally called by seekp( streampos ), seekg( streampos ), tellp(), and
tellg() methods. So its also possible to change and retrieve file postions
using iostream calls. But the problem lies in implicit handling of streampos
type.

streampos type is actually a template class used as seekp, seekg parameter
and returnd from tellp, tellg. Its capable of storing 64 bit file pointers.
But streampos can be also converted to/from simple type streamoff. It has
proper constructor and cast operator. In Win 32 environment streamoff is
defined as long (~32 bit int). So when seekp, and tellp arent used with
exact streampos objects but OSGA_Archive::pos_type complier makes implicit
casts to 32 bit int types loosing important bits of information.

So above problem could be easily handled by making conversion calls
explicit. My code defines 2 functions used to convert back and forth beetwen
64 bit OSGA_Archive::pos_type and std::streampos objects:

       OSGA_Archive::pos_type ARCHIVE_POS( const std::streampos & pos );
       std::streampos STREAM_POS( OSGA_Archive::pos_type & pos );

Rest of the OSGA implementation code was modified to call these conversions
explicitly with seekp, seekg, tellp, tellg.

---
Problem 2: seekp and seekg have two variants. Only one of these variants is
actually 64 bit proof.

When I solved my first problem and made use of explicit streampos conversion
functions, OSGA archive was able to read my example 11 GiB archive. But
there were still problems with write and append. I found that the reason for
this was pair of seekp( 0, std::ios_base::end ) and tellp() calls. It turned
out that use of seekp, seekg( offset, direction ) function variants was
setting file pos pointer to EOF when file was larger than 4GiB. But I
noticed that one arg seekp, seekg ( streampos ) versions worked correctly.
So the solution was to change OSGA write logic a little, and replace
seekp( offset, direction ) with seekp( absolute_pos ) calls.
I achieved this by modifing IndexBlock write method to record and restore
file pos after IndexBlock was written. This modification has the effect that
put pointer is generally kept at the end of file, so there is no need to
repostion to the end before writing the files. This allowed me to get rid of
those problematic seekp( 0, std::ios_base::end ) calls.

There was one place where I could not easily get rid of seekp( 0,
std::ios_base::end ). It was situation where existing OSGA was opened for
appending. I resolved this by computing file length by finding max position
from index block and file block endings. Then I replaced former seekp( 0,
std::ios_base::end ) with  seekp( STREAM_POS( found_file_length ).
---

Description of these changes may sound bit hacky but in practice these were
fairly simple and straightforward modifications. I hope they pass your
review. There is one complex preprocessor condition which I based on few
lines taken from boost positioning.hpp. Boost licence does allow such
reproduction. In case of problems this condition may be easily simplified to
windows only implementation.

3. User can supply a std:string object for the plugin to return the URI of
the document just processed.
4. User can supply a std::string to receive the unit name information from
the document just read in. (e.g. meters, inches, etc.)
5. User can supply a float to receive the metric conversion factor from the
document just read in.
6. User can supply an enum to receive the up axis orientation information
from the document just read in.
7. Material transparency can be both read and written.
8. User can supply an experimental GoogleMode option on output. The plugin
will try to emulate the way Sketchup specifies transparency (i.e. the
inverse of what it should be!). I am still struggling to get GE to
understand transparency, anyone know what it expects?
9. Rudimentary support for Collada effect parameters (newparam, setparam,
param) on input. Basic nVidia FX Composer dae documents can now be read.

From Mathias Froelich, "I have cleaned up the state set handling of the osg::ClipNode. Previously the complete StateSet was cleared, even the non clipping releted state attributes and modes in this stateset on a call to setLocalSetateSetModes. With this change only those modes/attributes are changed that need to be changed. That is, if a clip plane is removed from the ClipNode, only this assiciated mode is removed from the state set, instead of throwing away the whole state set.In this way we have less surprising results if the state set of a clip node is
used for more state than just the clip state.

release:

http://www.openscenegraph.org/svn/osg/OpenSceneGraph/tags/OpenSceneGraph-2.2.0

The changes where needed for being able to read VRML file which are
output by VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). A sample VRML file
is enclosed in this submission.

The plugin has been tested against a number of VRML samples that include
texturing. The texturing is found to be VRML97 compliant for all added
geometry nodes.

   be turned off.
* Reference plane: The resulting intersections are sorted
   by the distance to this plane.

New memebers of PolytopeIntersector::Intersection :

* distance: Distance of localIntersectionPoint to the reference plane
* maxDistance: Maximum distance of all intersectionPoints to the
   reference plane.
* intersectionPoints: The points intersecting the planes of the polytope
   or points completely inside the polytope.
* localIntersectionPoint: arithmetic mean of all intersection points
* primitiveIndex: Index of the primitive that intersected

This fixes the problems i was having.If you are curious, the writer was crashing when trying to write an

allocating an empty image of that size and writing it to a file."

Current safeguard for minimized window:LRESULT GraphicsWindowWin32::handleNativeWindowingEvent( HWND hwnd, UINT
uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam )
...
       /////////////////
       case WM_MOVE    :

...
               if (clientRect.bottom==0 && clientRect.right==0)
...

and clientRect.right > 0.

Quick fix to this is relax condition:
               if (clientRect.bottom==0 || clientRect.right==0)

Modified file is attached.

Tested with osgviewerMFC from 2.2.0 release (Windows XP sp2)

Before fix:
 - execute from command line osgviewerMFC.exe cow.osg.
 - the cow is rendered nicely.
 - resize window to zero height by dragging from bottom border upwards.
 - resize window back to original height
 - just blue screen, no cow

After fix:
 - execute from command line osgviewerMFC.exe cow.osg.
 - the cow is rendered nicely.
 - resize window to zero height by dragging from bottom border upwards.
 - resize window back to original height

From Mihair Radu, "Most of the additions are small utility methods: - set the resolution of the shadow map; it calls dirty() to re-initialize at next update - keep a list of Shader objects to use instead of the default ones, if the list is empty, the default shaders are used - explicitly create the Uniform variables, so that subsequent additions that require more Uniforms can put them in a central place - set a Light or LightSource to use explicitly for shadow casting, allows multiple lights in the scene, with one casting shadowsThere are two additions that do not ( yet ) function correctly, but in
the present usage they do not interfere with the regular usage of the
techique:
- support for using spotlights, it's using Light.spotCutoff to determine
if it's a spot-light and not point-light,
   there is an error in the setup of either the shadow camera or the
texgen, most likely due to the direction of the spotlight, since the
position is being used just like in point or directional lights.
- creation of a debugHUD
   the hud is created properly, ( the example included shows it ), but
it displays only white, there has been some discussion of displaying the
shadow map, but I could not find it, the addition of a simple fragment
shader with the appropriate color transform should get this going."

From David Spilling, "Please find attached an extension of the Radiance HDR (RGBE) image reader to support writing.The options are intended to match the existing read options. By default it will only write RGB32F format; if the "RAW" option is selected, it will output 8 bit RGBA as "raw" RGBE. Note also that the writer inserts a flipVertical(); although the RGBE format, according to spec, should support top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top ordering, no software I've found, including that from the formats originator, actually respects this."

From Dan Minor, "osgText::Text does not currently have a getAxisAlignment method.  The attached code adds this, along with a member variable to keep track of the setting.  It is based on the latest subversion version, and was tested by creating a new text object with the same axis alignment as an existing one (e.g. new_text->setAxisAlignment(old_text->getAxisAlignment()); )."From Robert Osfield, " I originally didn't add a getAxisAlignment()
as all setAxisAlignment does is set the Rotation member variable, and
potentially one could apply user defined Rotation setting after the
setAxisAlignment() which would bring it out of sync with the
setAxisAlignment.

Rather than reject your submission on the ground of potentially
getting out of sync and therefore misleading users I've added a
USED_DEFINED_ROTATION to AxisAlignment enum, and set this in the
serRotation and then override this setting of _axisAlignment in the
setAxisAlingment method.  I've also removed the lazy updating
optimization you've added to the top of setAxisAlignment to avoid
potential problems as well."

Andre Garneau, three fixes in one submissions:"This is a fix for the issue reported by Anders a week ago (see \u201c[osg-users] BUG?: mouse coordinate changes after window move\u201d discussion thread on Sept. 20). The issue was that the initial implementation added a few months back was not converting the window coordinates to client-area coordinates resulting in a slight offset each time a decorated window was moved (caused by the window border). This was also causing windows to move out of their assigned screen."

and

"Attached is a fix for the taskbar repaint issue that occurs when a graphics window is toggled from full-screen mode to windowed mode (as identified by Gert van Maren a couple of weeks ago).
Also included is a fix derived from the \u201cEvents from the past\u201d discussion thread that took place on July 11."

From Jose Delport: "have been using the new VIEW_DEPENDENT_WITH_ORTHOGRAPHIC_OVERLAY mode of the OverlayNode.I change the overlay subgraph dynamically and when I remove all the
subgraph nodes that is inside the current main camera FOV (others
outside still exist), the overlay texture does not update because of the
early return in the traversal. I then get a kind of ghost texture moving
around the terrain.

The attached file fixed the problem for me, but I'm not sure if it is
the best way to address the problem."

From Art Trevs, "Features of the patch are:- Implementation of integer textures as in EXT_texture_integer

- setBorderColor(Vec4) changed to setBorderColor(Vec4d) to pass double values
as border color. (Probably we have to provide an overloading function to
still support Vec4f ?)

- new method Texture::getInternalFormatType() added. Gives information if the
internal format normalized, float, signed integer or unsigned integer. Can
help people to write better code ;-)

"

Futher changes to this submission by Robert Osfield, changed the dirty mipmap
flag into a buffer_value<> vector to ensure safe handling of multiple contexts.

Moved defined from Texture2DArray into Texture

Fri, 7 Sep 2007 11:21:02 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Art Tevs,"A new texture class Texture2DArray derived from
Texture extends the osg to support the new
EXT_texture_array extensions. Texture arrays provides
a feature for people interesting in GPGPU programming.


Faetures and changes:

- Full support for layered 2D textures.

- New uniform types were added (sampler2DArray)

- FrameBufferObject implementation were changed to
support attaching of 2D array textures to the
framebuffer

- StateSet was slightly changed to support texture
arrays. NOTE: array textures can not be used in fixed
function pipeline. Thus using the layered texture as a
statemode for a Drawable produce invalid enumerant
OpenGL errors.

- Image class was extended to support handling of
array textures

Tests:
I have used this class as a new feature of my
application. It works for me without problems (Note:
Texture arrays were introduced only for shading
languages and not for fixed function pipelines!!!).
RTT with Texture2DArray works, as I have tested them
as texture targets for a camera with 6 layers/faces
(i.e. replacement for cube maps). I am using the array
textures in shader programming. Array textures can be
attached to the FBO and used as input and as output."

From Galen Faidley," Please find attached the modifications to get the new checkerboard stereo format to work.  It's a good thing I tested these on a TV before submitting them since I did indeed have a bug.  One thing I did not test was to see how this would work in windowed mode.  Does the interlaced stereo code have support for 'absolute' positions? For example a given pixel on the screen is always shown in a given eye no matter where the graphics context is placed? "

From Jean-Sebastien Guay,"As discussed yesterday on the osg-users list, I have altered src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp to implement the official Windows DLL search order as described on the page http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586.aspx . As mentioned, the search order is now:     1. The directory from which the application loaded.     2. The system directory. (C:\Windows\System32 by default, gotten using the        GetSystemDirectory function)     3. The 16-bit system directory. (C:\Windows\System by default, gotten by        adding "\System" to the path gotten in the next step...)     4. The Windows directory. (C:\Windows by default, gotten using the        GetWindowsDirectory function)     5. The current directory. (".")     6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable. (as        before)The first four directories are obtained using Win32 API calls, so they
should work correctly even on non-standard Windows installs.

The changes are well commented and should be clear, even to someone
not familiar with the Win32 API.

I have tested in a few scenarios and it works as expected. Serge Lages
has also tested the changes and confirmed they worked as described. I
have not had any other reports though (positive or negative).

I also fixed the issue with a trailing semicolon on the PATH adding an
empty string to the end of the search paths, as this was an
inconsistent side effect rather than a desirable effect. This change
will take effect on other platforms as well, but since it tests for an
empty string in the last item added to the search paths, it should
have no adverse effect.

From Maria Ten, "I divide the init method of the geometrytechnique in submethods to made more easy the inheritance between the user and osg-class. This is a first step to add more functions in osgTerrain. Maybe the subdivision of the method have to be in the terraintechnique because is the base class of GeometryTechnique. If Robert or anyone think that this is better i change this class too."

From Stephan Huber, "the softshadowmap-implementation does not compile on os x, to be more precise, the shader does not compile on os x because of some type-conflicts ala "can not convert from const int to const float"So I changed the offending lines to force the type of the vars. It works
now on OS X (albeit very slowly, 3fps on a 7300), perhaps you find the
changes useful. Note: perhaps there is a better way in shaders to
cast/convert from int to float and viceversa."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Luc Frauciel, "I've done 2 main modifications : 1) added texture->setResizeNonPowerOfTwoHint(false); when loading an image. It speeds up by 10 the loading of large images. 2) added a --disk option : only a filelist is read, images are only loaded when needed. It allows to handle very large set of very large images that would not fit in memory. Nothing change when the option is not set."

From Jan Ciger, "I am attaching an improved version of the OpenVRML plugin. It still uses OpenVRML 0.14.3 and is without the Boost dependency.The changes:
- - Fixed loading of textures and normals when no corresponding indices
are specified. It uses vertex indices now, compliant with the VRML spec.
- - Added colour per vertex support.
- - Added group node support.
- - Changed the code to use osg::ref_ptr instead of naked pointers to
avoid memory leaks.
- - Fixed breakage for loading files specified by relative path."

From Bruno Hebelin,"I have adapted to osgShadow the soft shadow map technique described in  "Efficient Soft-Edged Shadows Using Pixel Shader Branching" by Yury Uralsky, Chapter 17 of GPU Gems 2 (Matt Pharr ed. Addison-Wesley).

Here is my code in attachment: basically, it works in the same way as osgShadow/ShadowMap (core code is copied from it) but implements a specific GLSL shader for the soft rendering of penumbra.

I have tested it under Linux with a NVidia graphic card, but there should be no dependency on platform nor on the graphics driver (as far as they support GLSL 2). Screenshots attached show the current results (frame rate bound to v-sync, but the shader takes actually not much time)."

I also removed the limitation to 1024*1024 to 4096*4096, because when you are preprocessing your data with OSG, it can be useful to read large images/heigthfields.

From Mike Connell, "This is a tiny fix for win32.The current code takes the mouse cursor position and adds it to the
window (left,top) position, and sends the mouse cursor there. But this
doesn't take into account the window decoration.

The new code converts the given (x,y) coordinates from the client area
coordinate system to the screen instead using ClientToScreen. I think
this is the natural windows way to do it.

Tested on XP with osgviewer
"

Note from Robet Osfield, made a few changes to layout to make it more consistent 
with the rest of the OSG and used #if 0 instead if (0) blocks.

From David Callu,"
Found in the join file the fix for the bug found by Rafa.


    Problem :

        osgIntrospection::Value grp(new osg::Group);

        osgIntrospection::ValueList vlcall;
        vlcall.push_back(osgIntrospection::Value("toto"));

       const osgIntrospection::MethodInfo *m =
grp->getType.getCompatibleMethod("setName", vlcall, true);

       if (m)
       {
            m->invoke(grp, vlcall);      // ** SEGFAULT here
       }





    Algorithm explanation :

          The "invoke" method try to convert "grp", which reflect an
"osg::Group*", in a
          "osgIntrospection::Value", which reflect a "osg::Node*".
This because
          the "setName(const char *)" method found by
"grp->getType.getCompatibleMethod"
          is an "osg::Object" type method.

          When osgIntrospection do this conversion it try :
             - to found a "osgIntrospection::Converter"  to convert
               from "osg::Group*" to "osg::Node*"
             - to found a chain of "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
               from "osg::Group*" to "one or many type" to "osg::Node*"
             - to converte an Enum to int or unsigned int
             - to convert the value in its "value string representation",
               then converte this string in the destination value

          Else it throw a "TypeConversionException".







     Bug :

          1)
          When osgIntrospection try to found a chain of
"osgIntrospection::Converter"
          It could do any downcast or (Type to SuperType) or upcast
(SuperType to Type).
          This mean the the chain could be :
          osg::Group to osg::Transform to osg::Camera to
          osg::CullSettings to osg::CullStack to
osg::CollectOccludersVisitor to
          osg::NodeVisitor to osg::Referenced to osg::Object

         During the convertion with this chain, A METTRE failed and
the pointer in
         "grp" is set NULL. But the "grp" is always a valid
"osgIntrospection::Value"
         and so, osgIntrospection accept the conversion. Then it try
to use this pointer
         to call the "setName" function. And Bing SEGFAULT.


         2)
             In "bool Reflection::accum_conv_path( ... )"
             the convection path isn't accumulate in the recursive loop.
             this cause multi request of a conversion path, and a
slowdown in the
             conversion algorithm.

         3)
             Use of the last conversion way in a conversion from
pointer to pointer
             this mean you can do this :
             "osg::Node*" to " value string representation" to "osg::Material*"
             What a bad thing !!!




    Solution :

         1)
          Introduce the concept of dynamic_cast and static_cast.
          now, to do a conversion, osgIntrospection does this :

             - to found a "osgIntrospection::Converter"  to convert
               from "osg::Group*" to "osg::Node*"
             - to found a chain of "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
               from "osg::Group*" to "one or many type" to "osg::Node*"
               only with static_cast, downcast (Type to SuperType)

             - to found, if the source and the destination are two pointer,
               a chain of "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
               from "osg::Group*" to "one or many type" to "osg::Node*"
               only with dynamic_cast, upcast (SuperType to Type)

             - to convert an Enum to int or to unsigned int
             - to convert the value in its "value string representation",
               then convert this string in the destination value

          Else it throw a "TypeConversionException".


          Add the "enum CastType" to distinguish the static_cast or
dynamic_cast converter.
          Add file OpenSceneGraph/include/osgIntrospection/CastType

         2)
         add a line to accumulate converter in converter Path.

         3)
         add a line to check if source and destination are pointer.

From Stephan Huber and Robert Osfield,Stephan: "attached you'll find some modifications to the GraphicsWindow-class and
their platform-dependant implementations.

The problem:
setWindowRectangle and setWindowDecoration do not update the
traits-object, so, if you call setWindowRectangle on a
not-realized-window it will open with another size when realized later.
getWindowRectangle reports possible wrong sizes if setWindowRectangle
called before.

My solution:
split the implementation in two parts:
GraphicsWindow::setWindowRectangle will update its traits-object and
call afterwards the virtual method setWindowRectangleImplementation
(which is implemented by the derived platformspecific classess). For
setWindowDecoration I am useing a similar mechanism.

I hope you'll find the submission useful, the Win32 and X11 changes are
not tested but should work."

Changes to this made by Robert are call of resized in setWindowRectangle 
instead of setting of Traits, and use of a bool return type.

From Jason Daly, "We have a few OpenFlight files that used to display properly with the old loader, but appear very, very wrong with the new one.  I traced the problem to the handling of the palette override flags in the external reference records.  The current behavior for handling the palette override flags for external references has different offsets for different OpenFlight version (2 bytes for 14.2-15.1 and 4 bytes for 15.2 and later).  However, I believe this behavior is incorrect.I know that the original 14.2 OpenFlight spec (dated April 1995)
specifies 2 bytes between the filename and the override flags, and the
15.4 and later specs specify 4 bytes.  However, I also found a 14.2.4
OpenFlight spec (dated January 1996) that changes the specification to 4
bytes.  Also, the databases in question were created using an old IRIX
version of MultiGen II, which wrote OpenFlight 14.2 files natively.
These files also have 4 bytes between the filename and flags.
Furthermore, these databases have always worked properly under earlier
versions of OSG, under Performer, and in every MultiGen product we've used.

This leads me to believe that the original 14.2 spec was incorrect (the
14.2.4 spec corrected this error), and there should be 4 bytes between
the filename and flags for all OpenFlight files version 14.2 and later.

The attached fix modifies the OpenFlight loader to behave in this way."

From Jason Daly, "This changes the handling of textures in the OpenFlight loader. Currently, if the texture attribute file doesn't explicitly specify an internal format, the loader will force it to use GL_RGB, which keeps translucent textures (eg. GL_RGBA textures) from showing up properly.This patch changes the default behavior to simply use the image's format
instead of forcing a particular format."

From Eric Wing, "So, something strange happened to the repo and some of this project's files got messed up, most notiably the Nib and also the Localized strings file. I didn't notice the latter until now so Martin is missing this file.Anyway, the attached tar contains all new versions of all the
necessary files. There are cleanups and fixes to a lot of things.
Martin did a good job porting the thing to osg::Viewer so most of the
code changes I made address other areas.

Two things I noticed in the new port you might want to consider as
feedback. First, there might be a bug with osgViewer when the view
size goes to 0. If you play with the splitviews in this program and
shrink the view until it is closed, and then re-expand it, the model
doesn't come back, not even after a home() call. SimpleViewer didn't
have this problem.

Second, a more minor thing, this program has a
take-screenshot--and-copy-to-clipboard feature via Cmd-C (or Menu
item). I achieve this by using osg::Camera to render to an FBO and
then copy the contents to Cocoa. To insert the camera, I manipulate
the scenegraph so I can get the camera node in and out. I end up
calling setSceneData at the end of eveything to restore everything to
the original state before I started mucking with the scenegraph. This
unfortunately, triggers a home() reset. So in this particular case, it
make Copy look like it's changing the scene. The old SimpleViewer had
the same problem, but I was able to work around it by directly
invoking the underlying SceneView's setSceneData so the home()
mechanism was bypassed. The viewer design seems to protect this data
more carefully so the bypass trick won't work. My feedback is that
maybe a flag or extra parameter can be introduced so a reset is not
triggered if not desired.

I have checked in a ton of Xcode fixes for the entire build process in
general so once this piece gets checked in, hopefully everything will
build cleanly."

From Mike Wittman, "This change to genwrapper and osgIntrospection gives access to the declaring file for a given type via the new member function osgIntrospection::Type::getDeclaringFile.  This information is useful in order to know what header to include when auto-generating wrappers for a given type.During the C# wrapper generator development I've been keeping the
declaring file configuration state up-to-date manually with changes
to OSG, and it's proven to require substantial effort.  So it would be
extremely valuable to get this change in before 2.0 to reduce maintenance
during the lifetime of the release.  It'll also be equally useful to
others looking to create wrapper generators using osgIntrospection.

This is a fairly simple change and was tested with a fresh rebuild of the
entire suite of osgWrapper libraries, so it should be relatively low risk
(fingers crossed)."

Lots of various fixes to Xcode project.- Adding missing header files and making sure they are marked public.

- Support to copy headers in Viewer/api into the proper location in framework

- Internalized OpenThreads build so cross-project dependency is not needed. Can now delete copy of OpenThreads project. Frameworks use native Xcode linking mechanism. Plugins/Examples still use explicit -framework OpenThreads. Could potentially be problem is old OpenThreads is on the system. This can be changed to use native mechanism too, but requires some patience because it is tedious to change.

- Lots of fixes to osgViewerCocoa (something got messed up pretty badly...files are missing from repo). Another submission will need to readd these files back.

I changed the constructor method to accept the Equator radius and the Polar radius like parameters. By default, it assumes the Earth radius for the EllipsoidLocator. I added a setEllipsoidModel method, too.Now, we are developing some libraries for a GIS applicacion, and our
libraries can visualize terrains of planets like Mars. I think that is
a interesting change."

From Mathias Froelich, "have done an interface to change the mouse cursor in the X11 graphics window. The win32 implementation is still in its original shape since I have no win32 implementation available.I have chosen the enum approach for the first cut. That is benefitial since
the user does not need to track creation of mouse cursors for different
windows and displays in presence of multiple viewer windows.

The default set of available mouse shapes is the same set that was available
with glut. That set served many OpenGL applications well, so the hope is that
this is enough.

Even though, that implementation is still extensible:
I have digged out the way SDL defines new mouse cursors and added a still
documented out function prototype in the GraphicsWindow that can be used to
extend the current implemtation for arbitrary mouse shapes. That is not
implemented yet.

I hope that somebody with a win32 test system can catch up that implementation
on win32."

From Sherman Wilcox, "The issue itself occurs when a model is tessellated that has greater than unsigned short number of vertexes. An object called vertexPtrToIndexMap contains vertexes and their indexes. This std::map object can obviously hold a quantity that is greater than unsigned short, however osg::DrawElementsUShort objects were being created to reference these vertexes and their indexes. osg::DrawElementsUShort can only hold indexes that are 16-bit quantities....

proposed_patch_2\tessellator.cpp. This solution examines the size of
vertexPtrToIndexMap and selects 1 of 3 possible osg::DrawElements
objects: DrawElementsUByte, DrawElementsUShort, or DrawElementsUInt.
The main drawback of this particular solution is the code duplication.
However, the repair is straightforward."

I just added a check before a new default camera manipulator is added to ensure that the view allows event focus before a camera manipulator is added."

From Charles Cole, "Attached are mods to the OpenFlight plug-in to help further implement the specification.  With these mods, blink sequences are now created for flashing light point nodes, either palletized (v.15.8 and later) or non-palletized (15.7 and earlier).  Thanks to Brede for his implementation of the palletized light point nodes.There is still work to do on adding the capability to properly handle
light point system nodes, but this does add some capability that did not
previously exist.  So, I wanted to at least submit this and I will
hopefully provide the additional capability in the near future.

I've tested the code modifications with Visual Studio 2005.  I don't
have the means to test any other operating system, but I would suspect
that there shouldn't be any issue (famous last words).  I used the test
files that I uploaded to the users forum to test the changes.

In addition to the added capability, I changed the light point node
radius to the "actualPixelSize" value in the file.  Previously, the
radius was set to half the actual pixel size (see
LightPointRecords.cpp).  Not sure why this was the case.  But, it was
brought to my attention by a co-worker who created the OpenFlight files
and was testing them with different viewers.  If there's some history
for setting the radius to half the size, then this change can be
omitted."

From Charles Cole, "he attached code implements the LightPointSystem class to allow for the OpenFlight plug-in to read and handle light point system nodes.  The behavior is very similar to the old plug-in in that a MultiSwitch node is created to handle the "enabled" flag bit set in the node record.  The code also reverts the changes for the actualPixelSize as mentioned above.  And lastly, the code requires the previously submitted changes for the plug-in.As for the other changes, I've tested the code with Visual Studio 2005
and the files that I posted in the users forum.

With all of the submitted changes, the OpenFlight plug-in should now be
capable of loading files with light point system nodes and the use of
palletized light points and non-palletized light points.

From Peter Hrenka, (note from Robert Osfield, renamed GenericPrimitiveFunctor mention below to TemplatePrimitiveFunctor)."Since we desperately needed a means for picking Lines
and Points I implemented (hopefully!) proper geometrical tests
for the PolytopeIntersector.

First of all I implemented a new "GenericPrimiteFunctor"
which is basically an extended copy TriangleFunctor which also
handles Points, Lines and Quads through suitable overloads of
operator(). I would have liked to call it "PrimitiveFunctor"
but that name was already used...
I used a template method to remove redundancy in the
drawElements method overloads. If you know of platforms where
this will not work I can change it to the style used
in TriangleFunctor.

In PolytopeIntersector.cpp I implemented a
"PolytopePrimitiveIntersector" which provides the needed
overloads for Points, Lines, Triangles and Quads to
the GenericPrimitiveFunctor. This is then used in the
intersect method of PolytopeIntersector.

Implementation summary:
- Points: Check distance to all planes
- Lines: Check distance of both ends against each plane.
  If both are outside -> line is out
  If both are in -> continue checking
  One is in, one is out -> compute intersection point (candidate)
  Then check all candidates against all other polytope
  planes. The remaining candidates are the proper
  intersection points of the line with the polytope.
- Triangles: Perform Line-Checks for all edges of the
  triangle as above. If there is an proper intersection
  -> done.
  In the case where there are more than 2 polytope
  plane to check against we have to check for the case
  where the triangle encloses the polytope.
  In that case the intersection lines of the polytope
  planes are computed and checked against the triangle.
- Quads: handled as two triangles.

This is implementation is certainly not the fastest.
There are certainly ways and strategies to improve it.


I also enabled the code for PolytopeIntersector
in osgkeyboardmouse and added keybindings to
switch the type of intersector ('p') and the picking
coordinate system ('c') on the fly. Since the
PolytopeIntersector does not have a canonical
ordering for its intersections (as opposed to
the LineSegementIntersector) I chaged the
implementation to toggle all hit geometries.


I tested the functionality with osgkeyboardmouse
and several models and it seems to work for
polygonal models. Special nodes such as billboards
do not work.


The next thing on my todo-list is to implement
a an improved Intersection-Structure for the
PolytopeIntersector. We need to know
which primitives where hit (and where).

From Stephan Huber, "I cleaned the code a little bit and improved the handling of loops:I added a new protected virtual method to ImageStream called
applyLoopingMode()  which is called from setLoopingMode. The
quicktime-plugin has an implementation of applyLoopingMode which sets
some flags for the quicktime, so that quicktime handles the loop
playback by itself.

This has some benefits:

+ no gaps when looping audio
+ simplified code

Attached you'll find the modified files, hope you'll find them useful."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Michael Hartman, "I have gone in and created a CMakeList.txt file for osgviewerMFC application.Below is the changes made to the included files.  The examples CMakeList.txt file was not included but the code change needed for osgviewerMFC inclusion is listed below.

 

CMakeList.txt:

This is a little different than other example cmakelist.txt files in that I could not use the setup_example macro.   I had to go in and extract out the important parts of the macro and inline them in the CMakeList.txt file so that I could add the WIN32 declaration into the ADD_EXECUTABLE() statement.  In the future the setup_example macro might be modified to support osgviewerMFC but this is special case so you might not want to muddy the water for one example.

 

 

MFC_OSG.h:

This file had some small changes:

From: #include <osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32>

To:   #include <osgViewer/api/win32/GraphicsWindowWin32>

 

Also added two new function declarations

      Void PreFrameUpdate(void);

      Void PostFrameUpdate(void);

 

 

MFC_OSG.cpp:

This file changed only in that I am explicitly showing the viewer run loop and added the two new functions in the MFC_OSG.h file.

breaking existing applications). When set to true, the pixel format of the
inherited window will be set according to the traits specifications.

if you have both

instead of :

FIND_PACKAGE(Qt3)
FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4)

I had the project generated. But then due to the way CMake handles Qt4
I had to modify osgsimpleviewerQt4's CMakeLists.txt to have the binary
link with QtOpengl4. "

Author : Robert Osfield
From Farshid Lashkari, "I made a modification to the setClientActiveTextureUnit and setActiveTextureUnit methods of osg::State so they return false if the texture unit is outside the range of allowable units for the driver. Currently, the functions would return true even if the units are invalid. This would cause the osg::State to become out of sync with the actual driver state, which can cause some bugs in certain cases.The change I made would verify that the unit passed to
setClientActiveTextureUnit is below GL_MAX_TEXTURE_COORDS, and the
unit passed to setActiveTextureUnit is below
max(GL_MAX_TEXTURE_COORDS,GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS). I
modeled this behavior from the OpenGL docs for these commands which
can be found here:

http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glClientActiveTexture.xml

From Mike Weiblen, with mods of using references by Robert Osfield for efficiency.  Submission notes from Mike: "By repurpose, I'm creating a new plugin that uses much of the .osg fileformat, but with some changes.  Specifically, I'm creating a ".osgfs" plugin, which represents the scenegraph hierarchy as a filesystem of nested subdirectories and individual files for each node, rather than nested braces with everything in a single monolithic file.  I intend to incorporate file alteration monitor events to watch the filesystem for modifications and automatically reload.The problem I'm running into is osgDB is too tightly coupled to the .osg format.
osgDB::Output::writeObject() contains literal .osg format-specific strings like
"{" to represent the Object hierarchy at too low a semantic level.  I propose
using virtual methods; my plugin can then derive from osgDB::Output and
represent Object hiearchy differently.
"

Author : Robert Osfield
From Alan Harris, "Registry and Archive ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This is a simple change to permit databases other than those named "*.osga" to be used. It is hardcoded in read() at present.It is non-critical and does not affect existing program functionality.

Registry and Registry.cpp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a new typedef:      typedef std::vector< std::string>
ArchiveExtensionList;

a list of extensions:     ArchiveExtensionList  _archiveExtList;

and an "add" method:      addArchiveExtension(const std::string ext)

This is initialised by adding "osga" in Registry() and used in
Registry::read() where the list is searched for the extension used.

Archive.cpp
~~~~~~~~~~~
This submission is a little more tentative. openArchive() is modified to
automatically add the filename extension to the Registry extension list.

From Eric Wing, " Here are more changes for the CMake scripts:- I removed CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in FindOpenThreads as a follow up to
the discussion thread.

- I introduced an experimental CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to replace it.

- I added CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, and
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to the CMake GUI so users can enter values there
instead of in the environment.

- I added OPENSCENEGRAPH_*_VERSION variables (MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH).
These should be kept up-to-date with the real version numbers. Mac
bundles like to have version information so users can find out the
version they are running through standard About panels and also
automated system reporters for troubleshooting/bug tracking. In
theory, this information could be used for library versioning.
We should do the same for OpenThreads, but I forgot about it.

- I added some Mac Info.plist stuff (which uses the version information).

From Martin Aumueller, " a collegue of mine noticed that on Windows and X11 the modifier state (such as Alt or Ctrl) would be applied one key press too late: e.g. press & hold Alt, press a, release Alt, press a, press a would generate the key sequence a, Alt-a, a instead of Alt-a, a, a.The problem is also present on Carbon. Moving the call to setModKeyMask in
front of the call to keyPress fixed it for me on Carbon and X11. I suppose
that this will fix the problem for Windows as well."

From Eric Wing, "These enhancements make it much easier to control which libraries get found by FIND_ using environmental variables. The problem with the old script was that CMake searches what it considers system paths first. This makes it difficult to override in the case where you might have a stable version in /usr/local, but are trying to build a bleeding edge release in the non-standard location /bleeding-edge.I went to the CMake mailing list hoping to find a good solution to
this. Unfortunately, there isn't one, and I have to do something
rather bone-headed in the Find module. Basically, I have to run FIND_
twice: once with default search paths turned off and my environmental
variables listed, and again with standard search paths reenabled. At
least it works.

I also added a few more environmental variables, specifically:
OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR
OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR

These two variables address the shortcoming of OPENTHREADS_DIR in the
case where the include path and library path don't share a common
parent.

Put all this together, and you can setup an automated shell script or
Microsoft .bat file to configure and build your application in an
automated step.


You still should be able to use the key CMake variables like
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to find things, but it will
occur after the environmental paths are searched. The reason for this
is that the OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR and OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR are
more specific. This prevents the accidental ordering problem where you
might use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to find some other component like GLUT,
but didn't want to accidentally include an older version of
OpenThreads located in the same area.

As the ultimate override, you can still pass -DVAR=value arguments to
cmake and it will take these above all else. However, it's safer for
people to not use these in case we modify the script and change the
variable names.

Finally, I'm wondering if we can kill the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}
searches in the Find module. As I've said before, this is kind of a
hack and the variable wasn't really intended to be used in this way.
And I just got bitten by it in some bad corner cases. The problem is
that if you don't explicitly set the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}, CMake
sets a default value for it (such as /usr/local). The problem is that
/usr/local may not be the place you want searched. If you wait to set
the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} in the ccmake GUI, then FIND_ is already
run once on ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local. If you were planning to
change the value in the GUI, it's too late if you had a stuff in
/usr/local because FIND_ already found something and won't change the
value when you reconfigure since it is already set. You will have to
manually change the value yourself. Furthermore, as another problem
example, on the Mac, /Library/Frameworks is supposed to be searched
before /usr/local, but ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} kept causing stuff in
/usr/local to be hit first which took me a really long time to
understand how this was happenning. The work around is that I must
push the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} search to the very end as not to
conflict with anything else. But I think it would be much better if we
removed it entirely.

And with so many different environmental variables at our disposal, I
don't think we need this one:

(Checked by CMake automatically:)
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
PATH
LIB

(Checked by us:)
OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR
OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR
OPENTHREADS_DIR
OSG_INCLUDE_DIR
OSG_LIBRARY_DIR
OSG_DIR

general it shouldn't have the ${}. (I really hate this syntax.)"

From Eric Wing, " Changes include:A internal cache flag that can be used to detect if this is the first
time running the CMake configuration. This is needed to work around
stupid CMake UI shortcomings about the UI not reflecting anything you
SET unless you use FORCE. But if you use FORCE, you override anything
the user may try to set/override unless you have an exception check.
It turns out the exception check you need is often the first-run
check. This flag is potentially useful for other things too.

An optional switch that turns on more aggressive warnings based on
your compiler.

Some Apple specific stuff for detecting the OS version and enabling
Universal Binaries (and some additional compiler flags that are good
but gcc version dependent). The version check code is unfortunately
really fragile. I need to lobby CMake to return the OS X version
number for us. FYI, building Universal will fail with the current
CMake release due to a bug, but is now fixed in CVS.

From Luigi Calori, "when we link against something that comes out from a Find... we ususally have a variable <LINK_VAR_NAME>available like OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY,  so I' ve set up a macro that uses the variable name expanded for linking, and  test if a variable ${LINK_VAR_NAME}_DEBUG like OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DEBUG exists and in case uses it for linking in debug mode. I' ve also set up FindOpenThreads to set up these variables. I had to edit the core libraries CMakeLists to add the calls to the macros used. I' ve tested under MSVC"

From Mike Wittman, "This is another weirdo change to support code generation.  It brings all the Drawable::supports and Drawable::accepts overloads into the ShapeDrawable scope to avoid errors invoking the ones that are not defined in ShapeDrawable.  Currently you'll get compilation errors if you pass a Drawable::AttributeFunctor or PrimitiveIndexFunctor to the "accept" function invoked on a ShapeDrawable pointer or reference, since those overloads are only defined in the base class.  You'll also get the same error passing a PrimitiveIndexFunctor to the "supports" function.  These errors occur because C++ function overload resolution does not cross inheritance boundaries."

From David Callu, " bug:    Lost the functionality to find the real type pointed by a pointer.    Ex: a osg::Node pointer point on a osg::Group, if I look for information        on the pointer type, the introspection say it is a "osg::Node*".        But if I want information on the pointed type,        the introspection must return the "osg::Group".   This bug come from the osgIntrospection::Value::Ptr_instance_box::ptype() function.
   In the original version, this function use the member "Instance_base *inst_"
   like this :
      typeof(*static_cast<Instance<T> *>(inst_)->_data)

   But in the new version, this function use the template argument "T":
      typeof(typename remove_pointer<T>::type)

   This is a good meta-programming use, but here we need a dynamic request.

   Moreover the "typeof" macro define in "Reflection" header accept only a type in parameter with the new version.
   


 fix:
   Add the macro "typeofvalue" in "Reflection" header which accept a value or a type in parameter.
   Restore original code in osgIntrospection::Value::Ptr_instance_box::ptype() function.

From Brede Johansen, Thanks for the model it helped to understand the problem.  In Creator the "Last Frame Duration" is performed on the last frame of the last loop iteration, I tried to use it for the last frame of every loop iteration.  As you already have explained we need a custom Sequence node.  In the osgSim nodekit we already have a couple of specialized nodes for the OpenFlight format.  We need an osgSim::GroupAnimation but I don't have the time right now to take this challenge.  Until then I have modified my last attempt to work with the current osg::Sequence node by ignoring the "Last Frame Duration".

implemented the nodekit for my company, Fugro-Jason Inc., and they
have kindly agreed to open source it.

The nodekit contains a few draggers but it should be easy to build new
draggers on top of it. The design of the nodekit is based on a
SIGGRAPH 2002 course - "Design and Implementation of Direct
Manipulation in 3D". You can find the course notes at
http://www.pauliface.com/Sigg02/index.html. Reading pages 20 - 29 of
the course notes should give you a fair understanding of how the
nodekit works.

The source code also contains an example of how to use the draggers."

I'd pass it along.  Now the program will
not die if it encounters an ive file with bad

From Stephan Huber, "thomas kirk schrieb: > I put this at the end of realizeImplementation; someone with better knowledge > of Carbon programming may see a more appropriate place for the call.I moved your code into the ctor of the OSXCarbonWindowingSystemInterface
so it get called only once. Can you test it again, if it works on your side?

I also disabled multithreaded-rendering because it slowed down the
rendering on my machine by a factor of 3. Perhaps we can make it
optional to test it on other machines.

I had some problems implementing pbuffer-support for os x and stopped it
for now until I have more time to investigate the issues.

From Paul Martz, "Here's my changes to Registry to allow extension alias mapping via a config file. I also attached a sample file that tests the parsing, but this is just FYI and not for inclusion in CVS.To set up extension aliases using a config file, an app calls:
osgDB::Registry::instance()->readPluginAliasConfigurationFile(), passing in the file name as the parameter. (Of course this should be done before loading any files whose names depend on the mapping.) osgDB will search for the file using OSG_FILE_PATH.

The file should contain a line for each mapping, with the "map" extension first, followed by a space or tab, then the plugin identifier. For example, a file containing this line:

flt OpenFlight

would map the ".flt" extension to the OpenFlight plugin."

I added a new parameter, lineSpacing, in the Text class to allow the line spacing to be adjustable by the application. The default value is 0 meaning there is no extra spacing given. The value should be given as a percentage of the character height. A good value for longer paragraphs is 0.25 (25%) or more."

From André Garneau, "    * Setup proper pixel format for ATI boards (removal of WGL_SWAP_METHOD_ARB specification from the requested pixel format since unsupported by the ATI driver)

    * Fix to create sample OpenGL window on the proper display device. This is the temporary window used to choose the desired pixel format. In the previous version, this window was always created on the primary display device, even though it had potentially different pixel formats compared to the target display device containing the window to be created.

    * Implementation of WindowingSystemInterface::setScreenResolution() method

    * Implementation of WindowingSystemInterface::setScreenRefreshRate() method

    * Implementation of GraphicsWindow::requestWarpPointer() method

    * Implementation of GraphicsWindow::useCursor() method and associated trait support. This can be used in two ways; first, when the graphics trait requested indicates that no cursor should be present, a new cursor-less window class is used to create the window. When a cursor-enabled window creation is requested, another window class is used. After creation of a window, it is also possible to toggle the cursor state by using the GraphicsWindow::useCursor method.

    * The way the mouse behaves is now compatible with the behaviour seen on X11; i.e. when pressing a mouse button, the window where the pointer is located will capture the mouse input and release it only after the button has been released. This results in all mouse movement events being dispatched to the window where the button was pressed initially until it is released. This improves the interaction with graphics windows.



    * Preparation work has been done to support the ability of moving a window from one screen to another screen and recreating its rendering context when this happens. This has been tested with a mix of NVIDIA and ATI cards and works properly. For the moment being, this feature is commented out due to changes in the core OSG libraries that have been done but need to be submitted later this week for approval by Robert.



Upcoming features



    * Support for moving windows from one screen to another screen seamlessly



    * Ability to set the window (i.e. the application itself creates the rendering window and passes it to the GraphicsWindowWin32 class)



    * Other miscellaneous items"

From Mathias Fröhlich, "Attached is a small change that makes the txf loader render the same resulting text than an other well known txf loader. That means drawing them one on top of the other I can only see differences due to different mipmapping ...That is it introduces an additional gap of 0.1*height between the glyphs.
There is an additional mapping between upper and lowercase characters if one
of them is not available in the txf file.
And we have an artificial blank character that is very often missing in txf
files."

This is defined by default on Mac only, to avoid conflicts with the standard windows plugins. See comments on QTUtils.h

    * de-initialization of quicktime before exit is now left to an observer, which calls exitQuicktime() when last media loaded with the plugin is released. This prevent a crash on exit without need of any extra call external to the plugin."

From Tom Jolley, "There was some unnecessary creation and deletion of Particle objects in include/osgParticle/ParticleSystem.  I replaced   Particle(ptemplate? *ptemplate: _def_ptemp)

with

   ptemplate? *ptemplate: _def_ptemp

in a couple of places.  This should make particle creation and reuse go
a little faster without all that memory allocation and copying."

From Stephan Huber, "New features: + Multi-display-support + automatic hiding of the menubar/dock if one of the windows intersects the menubar/dockBugfixes:
+ event-handling was done by the first opened window, other windows did
not receive events -- fixed
+ mouse-coordinates were absolute, now they are relative to the window.

known bugs:
+ windows with decoration and in fullscreen-size are moved by the system
a little bit, so that the titlebar is accessible/visible. So if you want
real fullscreen-windows, don't decorate the window :)

I updated the XCode-project-file so all ported examples are linked
against osgViewer."

From Geoff Michel, "New delaunay triangulator attached. I hadn't realised that the erase() method was not erase (first, last) but erase (first, one after the last one you want deleted). This made a big difference; however some of the edges of the terrain were not included as edges in the terrain so I increased the size of the supertriangle, which works but reduces accuracy due to the larger range of coordinates in the supertriangle. (A larger supertriangle forces the triangles using supertriangle vertices to be long and thin, making the triangulation fit the convex hull of the terrain.)The loss of accuracy should not affect 'normal' users with terrains that are roughly square (say up to 100:1 aspect ratio) and where the Z range is comparable to the X-Y range. Retested with Pauls data, amalric's strange polygon constraint and the standard test constraints.

I also added 2 tests for routines with a NULL argument passed to them (no-one would usually pass a NULL pointer to these routines unless - as I did in testing- you remove some of the constraints but still pass their pointer to the routine). And I removed 3 tests for triangles which are already removed when generating the geometry.

NB Paul - the previous delaunay triangulator fails under VS8 IF it has any constraints as it attempts to use some vertices that have already been deleted when applying the constraints to edges. Under VS6 and less rigorous compilers it works as the deleted vertices are still in the points stl::Vector; however any added vertices would replace one of the supertriangle vertices with non-disastrous but wrong results."

Note, merged with latest name changes in CVS.

From Rick Pingry, "n my application I am walking through the scene graph looking for nodes of a specific name.  I noticed there were times when some of the nodes were not named what I had expected.   Upon reviewing the code, I noticed this was happening when there was a forward reference to a parented object.The existing code uses a map with object ID's.  The original code only applied the name to a node for a new ID only if the node did not already exist in the map.  The problem was that there was another part of the code (when a parent was forward declared) that also created the node with the ID in the map, but it did not know its name.  I simply made sure that the name was set regardless of whether or not the node was already in the map. "

From Roger James,"I have had another go at the windows specific file name handling in daeWMaterials.cpp. I think I have arrived at a temporary compromise.I have decided to just normalise the drive letter part of file names for the time being and also ensure that names of the format x:/xxxxx are treated as absolute paths. This will cover a lot of cases.

I have raised a bug against collada which hopefully should resolve some others. However there are some pathological cases which I have commented on in the code, these will probably never work properly unless there is a significant rewrite of the daeURI functionality. Hopefully they are rare."

From Bryan Thrall, "Currently, the DatabasePager always loads requested Nodes using the default Registry Options object, but it would be useful to be able to request loading with a different Options object. The attached files allow you to do that (based off the OSG 1.2 source).For example, I'm implementing a loader that requires context information
when it pages in subgraphs, which becomes significantly complicated when
multiple scenegraphs are requesting subgraph loads with different
contexts (the loader needs to know which context to use, and the
Registry Options needs to be carefully managed so the context settings
don't clobber each other, especially in multithreaded situations). Being
able to pass an Options instance along with the Node request resolves
this problem."

From André Garneau, "The file submitted includes a fix to properly support DDS textures compressed under the DXT-1 format when they contain alpha information.Under this mode, each 4x4 texel block can selectively use an alpha component or none. When alpha-enabled blocks are present, this is not reported in the DDPF_ALPHAPIXELS bit in the pixel format flags causing the reader-writer to report the file as a 3-components file (GL_COMPRESSED_RGB_S3TC_DXT1_EXT). The fix requires looking at each 4x4 texel block to detect the presence of 1-bit alpha encoding. When such a block is found, the internal & pixel formats are reported as GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT1_EXT instead.



See http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/Opaque_and_1_Bit_Alpha_Textures.asp for more information."

From Sylvan Marie, "I attached my revised dxfEntity.cpp file from the DXF plugin with the 2 following improvements:- When all unsupported entities (SOLIDS, TEXT, ...) have been filtered out
from a block, dxfInsert::drawScene() was crashing because it assumed that
the block was not empty. It now returns silently so the other blocks can
still be imported.

- The DXF reader assumed all vertices were read first, then the face
indices. But, from the DXF "documentation" (www.autodesk.com/dxf) :
"Polyface meshes created with the PFACE command are always generated with
all the vertex coordinate entities first, followed by the face definition
entities. The code within AutoCAD that processes polyface meshes requires
this ordering. Programs that generate polyface meshes in DXF should generate
all the vertices then all the faces. However, programs that read polyface
meshes from DXF should be tolerant of odd vertex and face ordering."
So now the importer ignores the posted number of vertices and face indices,
and uses the size of the lists instead."

From Mathias Froehlich, "Improovments: - does proper edge detection with the crease angle given in the ac file - the reader is much more verbose in case of broken files - no more static variables - std::stream based - much faster, up to a factor of 50 for a polygonal test model - if the file contains polygonal surfaces the loaded geometry is still polygonal as long as the polygons are convex. Concave polygons are still tesselated. Rationale: If the user needs triangular models he can throw away that extra information with the osgUtil::Optimizer himself. But the read step preserves as much extra information that is contained in the file as possible. Also the polygonal models look a bit smoother than the triangular ones. - a huge cleanup - the basic parsing logic from the original ac3d developer is untouched - the writer part is untouchedThe tarball contains a replacement for the src/osgPlugins/ac3d directory that
is based on the current CVS (2006-11-13).
I have tested that loader with a osgconv foo.ac /tmp/xx.ive on everyfoo. ac
file I could find (~200 from flightgear and the object database). I also run
my flightgear development with that loader -> here I see the models.
I run valgrind testcases on some selected models."

3 Getter for retrieval of the first particle in the trail. This allows you to directly manipulate the trail from your application by walking from the start particle towards the end of the trail."

From Michael Henheffer, "There's a problem with OverlayNodes where the texture will not display if continuous updating is set to false.The problem was being caused by the camera update call never being made
if continuous updating was not set to true.  This fix adds a flag that
is set when dirtyOverlayTexture() is called and checked in the update
visitor section of the traversal to determine if the camera should be
updated.

I tested the fix by making some changes to the osgAnimate example
program so it has continuous updating off and calls dirtyOverlayTexture
for each frame.  The overlay texture now displays properly."

switch->insertChild(0, child, false);
switch->insertChild(1, child, true);

child will not be used in computeBound, but will be drawn.

Solution:
Changed compute bound to loop over children using an index instead of an
iterator. This behaviour matches that of the traverse method."

From Michael Henheffer, "Bug:  The reader would crash when trying to load a .tif image that contained an 8-bit color map.  The crash occured at line 545:remap_row(currPtr, inbuf, w, red, green, blue);


Cause:  The code was trying to write past the end of the buffer while
doing this remapping.  The size of the buffer is determined based on the
value of 'format', which was 1 in this case since bitspersample is
8(indicating a 8-bit color map).  The buffer should have been created 3
times as large since that 8-bit value is indexing a 24-bit color.


Fix:  I've put in an if statement to set format to 3 if 'photometric'
indicates the tif contains a palette as the output data will always be
24-bit color data in this case."

Tue, 17 Oct 2006 15:17:06 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From David Callu:"
  the main problem is the wrapper generation:
       The PropertyInfo class use MethodInfo class to access to the value.
       When the property are define with the I_Property* macro,
       the MethodInfo use by the property to have access to the value
       are instancied in the I_Property* macro, but there
       are already instantied by the I_Method* macro before


   secondary problem:
      - the function used by the property could no be customized
        in the genwrapper.conf file
      - an array property can't insert a value
      - the std::map reflector (and indexedProperty in general) haven't remove method
      - about the help in wrapper ... why not ...



   solution :
      To use the function define by the I_Method, I add a MethodInfo variable in the I_Method0 macro
        old macro :
           #define I_Method0(ret, fn) (\
           params.clear(),\
           addMethod(new osgIntrospection::TypedMethodIn
fo0<reflected_type, ret >(qualifyName(#fn), &reflected_type::fn, params)))

        new macro :
           #define I_Method0(ret, fn, signature, briefHelp, detailedHelp) \
           params.clear(); \
          osgIntrospection::MethodInfo* signature = addMethod(new osgIntrospection::TypedMethodInfo0<reflected_type, ret >(qualifyName(#fn), &reflected_type::fn, params, briefHelp, detailedHelp)); sink(signature)



    the osgIntrospection::MethodInfo* signature is used by the I_Property macro to define the MethodInfo that it use

    so for I_Property macro :
        old macro :
          #define I_PropertyWithReturnType(t, n, r) \
          cap=addProperty(new osgIntrospection::PropertyInfo(osgIntrospection::Reflection::getType(typeid(reflected_type)), osgIntrospection::Reflection::getType(typeid(t)), #n, \
          I_Method0(t, get##n), \
          I_Method1(r, set##n, IN, t, value)))

         new macro:
           #define I_SimpleProperty(t, n, get, set) \
           get, \
           set))

      The genwrapper has been modified in this way.
      The method signature is define by the prototype of the method
      For example, the "const char* libraryName();" have "__C5_char_P1__libraryName" for signature


   solution for secondary problem:
      The genwrapper accept new tokens in the configuration to custumize the property.
      The new PropertyInserter and the CustomPropertyInsertAttribute class has been defined
      The PropertyRemover has been added to the StdMapReflector
      The _briefHelp and _detailedHelp variable has been added in PropertyInfo, MethodInfo and ContructorInfo class






   modification:

      I have modify the genwrapper files
          Configuration.cpp Configuration.h                          add some tokens to custumize the property
          Doxyfile.template                                                 add the comment in the output xml
          genwrapper.conf                                                  customize some property in osg::Geometry
          RegistryBuilder.h RegistryBuilder.cpp                    add the process_help function (to extract help from xml)
          TypeRegister.cpp TypeRegister.h                         optimize the property detection
          TypeDesc.h TypeDesc.cpp                                   modify FunctionDesc and PropertyDesc
          WrapperGenerator.h WrapperGenerator.cpp          modify the output




      I also modify the fallowing osgIntrospection files:

          include/osgIntrospection/Attributes                              add the PropertyInserter and the CustomPropertyInsertAttribute class

Mon, 2 Oct 2006 11:38:25 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Andreas Ekstrand, "Attached is a modified ReaderWriterDAE.cpp which creates the one and only DAE instance when it's first needed instead of in the constructor. This fixes the problem with osgdb_dae.dll not being loaded due to unwanted ordering of global initialization.This fix and the previous fix of the COLLADA plugin might be unnecessary
with the latest COLLADA DOM, but since many of us will probably still
use the older version of the DOM, I guess it's better this way.

From Chris Hanson, "These changes break out the implementation of the fill/wireframe/point, texture, lighting and backface culling settings from the event handling code in StatesetManipulator into public methods. The event handler now calls the public methods. This allows user code to invoke this same functionality from non-keyboard event inputs without clashing with the keyboard-invoked functionality."From Robert Osfield, tweaks to the above to kepp the coding style the same as the rest of the OSG, also
made getPolygonMode() const, and updated the wrappers.

Added support for imagery and DEM's that wrap around the dateline, this required two passes over the copying of imagery and DEM's to the destination graphs, once for the original position, and once for the wrap around 360 degrees on or before.Also fixed the GeospationExtents constructor that was setting the _max to DBL_MIN rather
than -DBL_MAX.  This bug causesd the y axis to be computed incorrectly.

Mon, 4 Sep 2006 13:15:08 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Farshid Lashkari,"I've made some changes to osg which I think make it easier to control
the render order of CameraNode's. Instead of using the built-in orders
(PRE_RENDER, POST_RENDER, NESTED_RENDER), you can specify an integer
order. Values less than zero are pre rendered in order. Values greater
than zero are post rendered in order. And a value of 0 is equivalent
to NESTED_RENDER.

The changes should be fully backward compatible. Also, I changed the
RenderStageList type from a vector to a list because I needed to be
able to insert values anywhere in the list.

The reason I made these changes was because I wanted to be able to set
the render order of a CameraNode at runtime without having to reorder
it in the scenegraph."

and later in the final submission message (relating to what has been finally been merged)    :

"I've rethought my implementation and came up with something a little
better. The setRenderOrder will continue to take an enum, but will
have an optional orderNum parameter which can be both positive and
negative. I think this method is more intuitive and flexible."

From Eric Wing, "Attached is a change for GLExtensions.cpp that allows OS X to use dlopen/dlsym instead of NS*Symbol* functions for 10.3 or later. The latter is now deprecated.I'm not completely sure how to test the changes. But I compiled these
new changes in and ran the osgvertexprogram and osgshaders examples
and they seemed to display the same results as before.

With respect to the use of dlopen and dlsym, I was uncertain if the
usage should look like Sun or FreeBSD (or something else). Apple's man
pages discourage the use of RTLD_DEFAULT so I avoided the FreeBSD
implementation and copied the Sun implementation. I'm not sure if this
is correct/ideal or not."

From Farshid Lashkari, "I was experiencing hard crashes of my application when using PBO's on machines that don't support PBO's. I think osg incorrectly checks if PBO's are supported.I added a new method to the BufferObject::Extensions class which

fixes the problem on my end. Machines without PBO support will
continue to work and machines with PBO support will still be able to
use it."

From David Guthrie, "I know there are 50,000 changes to osg/Math for OSX a day, but I think it can be simplified quite a bit.  The old code includes <cmath> for pre-10.2 and anything using something other than g++ 4 and then uses std::isnan.  For the most current version, it leaves out cmath and uses isnan().  std::isnan and cmath work for the current version, so I just made it include cmath if __APPLE__ is defined and removed the ifdef between versions of OS X for isnan related things.This way the code is all the same, and it's not fragile to someone
including <cmath> prior to including osg/Math."

The issue was that the new interpolation code I submitted didn't use the SourceData's georef, it was assuming that the GDALDataSet had a proper geo-ref.  I've made the getInterpolatedValue method a member of SourceData and now it uses the georef the SourceData's georef.I also forward declared the GDALRasterBand class in the DataSet header."

Author : Robert Osfield
From David Spilling, "Matrix_implementation.cpp modified as requested. I ran a version of it through a local version of osgunittests.cpp and it passes.Note that firstly it always returns the positive real quaternion (positive w)

Note also that it will sometimes slightly differ from the results of the other methods because it assumes that the input matrix really is a rotation matrix - if it isn't, e.g. because of rounding error, then the output quaternion will be very slightly different. For example, the test matrix

0 1 0 0
1 0 0 0
0 0 0.999999 0
0 0 0 1

will return 0.707107 0.707107 0.0005033 0.0005033

whereas the previous methods return 0.707107 0.707107 0.0 0.0

However, since quaternions are rotations, the meaning of how to convert a matrix that isn't a rotation is a little unclear..."

From Antoine Hue,"There was a typo in "int setNotifyOffset()", appear to be a getter =>
"int getNotifyOffset()".

Then I have added a switch to create GDALTermProgress only when the
current notify level + local offset permit message display. In fact, if
the offset is set to 0 and the notify level is at the default, DataSet
is quiet but for the GDALTermProgress. That is quite disturbing since
you think the progress is related to the complete processing but it is
actually only related to the GDAL Warp."

From Eric Sokolowsky, "The attached Texture.cpp fixes a problem when subloading compressed textures.  Near the top of the function that implements texture subloading, osg::Texture::applyTexImage2D_subload(), the local variable compressed_image examines the _image's_ pixel format to see if it is compressed. However, further on, in calls to getCompressedSize() the _texture's_ pixel format is used. In my application's Texture2D class, I use osg::Texture::USE_ARB_COMPRESSION to osg::Texture2D::setInternalFormatMode(), which causes the internal format to become one of the generic ARB_COMPRESSED types, which do not have a specific size. Thus the recent warning message added to osg::Texture::getCompressedSize() is triggered. The correct behavior is to use the format mode from the Image class instead of the Texture class within the subload implementation, and then the size is calculated correctly."

From Paul Martz,"Previously, the new OpenFlight plugin only allowed ext ref models to use
their own palettes. With this change, parent models can override child model
palettes with the parent palettes.

These changes are made against very current CVS (just updated about 1/2 hour
ago, eliminated conflicts, and retested before this posting).

To regurgitate what I did:

A new class, ParentPools (public osg::Referenced), is created when an ext
ref record is parsed, and it is populated with any parent model pools that
should override the child model pools (according to bits in the ext ref
record). The ParentPools object is then set as UserData on the ProxyNode
corresponding to the ext ref.

When the ReadExternalsVisitor hits the ProxyNode, it takes its UserData and
sets it as UserData in the Options parameter to the osgDB::ReadNode call,
which then read the ext ref model. In the course of parsing the Options
string, ReaderWriterFLT also looks at the Options UserData and sets the
parent pools in the Document class accordingly.

When palette records are encountered while loading a file, they are ignored
if the corresponding pool was set by the parent.

Thanks to Brede for consulting with me on the implementation.

From Stephan Huber,"attached you'll find some modifications to Producer, osgGA and
osgProducer to enable Mac OS X support for

+ scrollwheels,
+ mightymouse-srollballs
+ new tracking-pads with scroll feature
+ tablet-support (pressure, proximity and pointertype) (Wacom only tested)

I think there was a bug in the windows-implementation of scroll-wheel
support (wrong order of ScrollingMotion-enum, casting problem) which is
fixed now.

The scrollwheel-code is a bit klunky across platforms, some devices on
OS X can report an absolute delta in pixel-coordinates not only the
direction, so for now there is scrollingMotion (which describes the
direction) and scrolldeltax and scrolldeltay. I decided to leave the
scrollingmotion-stuff to not break old code relying on this."

From Brede Johansen,"The attached file corrects two small typos in MultiSwitch.cpp.  The
local "values" reference and the "_values" member attribute are of

future proof solution but the submission only removes the underscore
in two places.

The switch_1701.flt model part of the Creator gallery revealed this bug."

From Terrex and Andrew Sampsom and Don Tidrow and Robert Osfield,email comments from Andew Sampson,

"I've contacted Terrex, and obtained the 2.2 version
of their trpage library.  The library included a
fork of OSG 0.9.8's txp plugin, modified to load 2.1+
txp DBs.

I've done the work of incorporating the changes made
to OSG's txp plugin since 0.9.8 into Terrex's fork.
The forked version is now up-to-date with the changes
made to OSG 0.9.9 and 1.0.

Terrex made a lot of changes (especially differences
in whitespace), so the diff between the forked version

and OSG 1.0's txp plugin is yucky.  I did my best, but

keep in mind that this is the result of a 4-way merge
(kinda... terrex-0.9.8, stock-0.9.8, stock-0.9.9,
stock-1.0).

I really want to see this forked version merged back
into the main OSG branch.  The new features offered by

this version of the plugin (2.1+ support, variable
LOD support, bug fixes) are worth the trouble."

--

Don Tidrow then took this code and added his work.

--

Robert Osfield then fixed all the warnings that abound in the trpage code base.

From Philipp Siemoleit,    There are some group codes (i.e. "62") which are interpreted as
    dxfDataType::SHORT. That's right because the dxf-specification defines
    "16 bit integer" as the type for the corresponding value.
    But readerBase::readGroup() calls readValue(std::ifstream&, unsigned
    short). I changed readValue(std::ifstream&, unsigned short) to
    readValue(std::ifstream&, short). I found no group code at the dxf-specs
    which needs a "16 bit unsigned integer" value. So the
    readValue(std::ifstream&, unsigned short) function is obsolete - right?

From Paul Martz, "This change is based on current CVS. (Note both Brede and I have submitted changes to this plugin that aren't in current CVS yet -- this change is based on current CVS, not our changed files.)This changes how shader palette records are parsed to support GLSL per the
OpenFlight 16.1 spec. Existing functionality for 16.0 files is preserved.

The change to Document.h simply adds an enum for VERSION_16_1."

From Farshid Lashkari, "The following patch adds a multisample option to the osg::DisplaySettings class. OsgCameraGroup will now read the setting from the DisplaySettings instead of hardcoding the value. I added the following commandline option to be able to set the multisample value:--samples <num>

One thing to note, OsgCameraGroup would previously check if the
computer is an SGI and set multisample to 4. I retained this check in
DisplaySettings to be backwards compatible."

From Andrew Sampson, "The terravista terrain generation tool can insert references to external model files into a terrapage tile.  It unfortunately does not update the bounding sphere of that tile to include the extents of the external model.  This means that if a large model (such as an airfield model) is attached to a tile, the model will disappear when the tile is off-screen (outside the view volume), even though the model is on-screen."

From Farshid Lashkari, "A while back the behaviour of extension alias' was modified so that the user can override existing alias'. The change allowed for circular references, so the createLibraryNameForExtension would get caught in an endless loop. The following fix will catch circular references."

Wed, 8 Mar 2006 15:26:39 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Farshid Lashkari, "I noticed that sometimes when a particle emitter is re-enabled, a few particles will appear at the location it was disabled at. The problem is that the previous local to world matrix is not being updated while it is disabled. I modified the particle processor so that it will set the dirty flag for the previous local to world matrix when the processor is skipped for a frame, since the value will no longer be relevant."

Wed, 8 Mar 2006 15:16:59 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Roger James, "1. Fixed a problem with the caching of textures when the associated image file was not in the current working directory. In this case the texture object was being placed in the cache with the short filename, but was looked up with the full path.2. Fixed a problem with the caching of textures when CACHE_IMAGES was enabled. This caused a conflict is the names used to cache the image and texture objects.

3. Fixed a problem where AC3D generates surfaces with duplicate vertex indices.

4. Removed what I believe are redundant calls to the tesselator.

5. Added a couple of asserts which should fire in debug mode if my assumptions about 4. are incorrect.

6. Removed obviously unused code. (Stuff that was commented or ifdeffed out.)"

Note, from Robert Osfield, changed the asserts to if () report error using notify so we can catch errors in both optimized and debug builds, but without crashing.

From Farshid Lashkari, "I've attached another modified version of the IVE loader which supports compressing the image data. The option to compress the data is "compressImageData". Currently it uses the jpeg plugin to write the image. Maybe we could add an option that allows the user to specify which image format to use. The jpeg writer supports specifying the quality of the jpeg, so you could use the following command line to convert the skydome.osg model to IVE using 50% jpeg quality:osgconv -O "compressImageData JPEG_QUALITY 50" skydome.osg skydome.ive"

From Farshid Lashkari, "I've made some changes to the IVE loader which will add the capability of saving image files inside the IVE file. Currently, only the raw image data is saved into the file. If your model uses jpg images as textures then this will cause your file size to increase.I've added an option that will embed the original image file into the
IVE file. The IVE file will then attempt to read the image from
memory. Since most image loaders support reading from memory, this
shouldn't be a problem. To use this new feature the user must specify
the option "includeImageFileInIVEFile" when converting to IVE.

I tested this out on the "skydome.osg" model that comes with OSG.
Using the old method, the IVE file size would be 785 KB, with the new
method it is only 42 KB.

Also, I've added the support for TextureRectangle's to the IVE reader/writer."

It depends on _firstTimeToSetEyePoint, which is initially true, then false after a cull. There might be a better way? If so, let me know.This change does resolve the issue I had encountered with auto scale to
screen and incorrect culling."

Sat, 4 Feb 2006 21:20:25 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Marco Jez, " I've modified in order to make FBO mipmapping work. In FrameBufferObject.cpp there is also another fix: when initializing a FBO attachment from a CameraNode attachment, the renderbuffer's format must be set to the attachment's internal format, not to the image's pixel format.Another problem is that attaching a renderbuffer to the FBO through
CameraNode is not simple (if not impossible) if you don't intend to specify
an Image object. Probably CameraNode could be enriched with an
"attach(buffer, width, height, format)" method. For example if you attach a
color buffer as a texture whose size is different than that of the
CameraNode's viewport you also need to attach a depth buffer of the same
size, because the depth buffer that is automatically attached by RenderStage
has the viewport's size. FBOs require that all attachment have the same
dimensions, so said setup will fail if you can't specify a custom depth
renderbuffer"

Author : Robert Osfield
From Marco Jez:here is a patch that enables a new option named "BIND_TEXTURE_MAP" in the LWO plugin. Its purpose is to allow explicit binding between texture UV maps defined in the LWO file and OpenGL texture units, overriding the default mechanism that allocates texture units automatically. This is useful when you have an UV map built in Lightwave (for example an atlas map) but no textures actually using it, so you can keep the UV map (that would be discarded otherwise) and add a texture later int your program.

Syntax is:
BIND_TEXTURE_MAP <map_name> <texunit>

The OpenFlight plugin was crashing with pre 15.6 .flt files that contained light points.  This was due to the mismatch is size and fiels in the LightPointRecord before 15.6 and after it, the OSG's flt plugin was assuming just 15.6 record structure.  As a temporary solution I have disabled the processing of light point records on .flt file version before 15.6, this allows these files to be loaded safely, but without light points.

Fri, 18 Nov 2005 10:03:11 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Andrew Reyonolds : changed the endian conversion code to work on a temporary rather then on a flt structure to prevent repeated conversion of the same value, something that led to eroneously large light point string sizes.

From Farshid Lashkari : "I reported earlier about a problem with a custom emitter I was using. I spent some more time debugging and it turns out there was a bug in the ParticleSystem::update_bounds function. When the bound is being reset, both the min and max are being set to the same postion without the radius being subtracted/added to it. When there is only one particle alive in the system this causes it to be culled by small feature culling. I've modifed the function so that when the bound is reset, the radius is subtracted/added to the position. This fixes my problem."

From Brad Colbert/Robert Osfield: added s/getSourceFormat and s/getSourceType to osg::Texture along with support for this Texture1D, 2D, 3D, TextureCubeMap and TextureRectangle.  The new SourceFormat and SourceType parameters are only used when no osg::Image is assigned to an osg::Texture, and main use is for render to texture effects.Added support for --hdr option in osgprerender, which utilises the new Texture::setSourceFormat/Type() methods.

From Wang Lam,"The changes allow users of OpenSceneGraph to call a new function readFontStream() to load fonts from a std::istream, rather than from the local filesystem by name.  Such a call may be used, for example, if the user has a font fetched over a network, or a font available in memory without a correspondng filename.The changes implement the new function by following the corresponding code
for readFontFile().  readFontStream() reads a stream into memory, and
holds that memory for FreeType.

As a basic test, I mangled the osgtext example to use
readFontStream(std::ifstream("font")) in lieu of a readFontFile call, and
the modified example ran completely."

Moved SceneView across to use an osg::CameraNode to store the projection and view matrices, the viewport, the clear colour and the subgraph needing rendered.

    old style road segments ( from Multigen II w/road
    tools on IRIX ) in the same way as the newer road
    constructions. ie create a group and do a nested

    This makes roads appear in older format files where
    there was previously a gap.  This actually works
    properly with the paths which are marked as hidden in

From Marco Jez, "Problems fixed:1. type converters created automatically by the I_BaseType macro use
static_cast<> even for base-to-derived conversions. dynamic_cast<> should be
used instead.
2. as a consequence of the above fix, I_BaseType must now differentiate
between polymorphic and non-polymorphic base classes, because the latter
can't be dynamic_cast'd to derived classes. Some template magic (see
is_polymorphic<> in ReflectionMacros) is used to detect polymorphism at
compile time (I'm NOT sure it works on all platforms as it's partly
implementation-dependent. Please test!).
3. predefined custom property getters/setters/counters/etc. (as those
defined for STL containers) only work on Value objects that contain
non-pointer instances. This was an unwanted restriction that no longer
exists.

Wrappers will need to be recompiled. This is a good time to give them a
fresh update with genwrapper.

NOTE: fix #1 should get rid of those crashes and strange behaviours that
some users noticed while using osgIntrospection through osgTcl or in their
own code."

From Gordon Tomlinson: " This fixes some crashing issues I was having with certain FLT files that only had partial colour palettesWhich are typically found in older 14.x files and file converted through Polytrans or Deep exploration etc.

The code that grabs the color entries in ConvertFromFLT::visitColorPalette was assuming that there were full
palettes always coming in and stepping was out of bounds in certain cases (not all) and thus crashing with
access  violations etc,

Although the normal from Creator is to have 1024 or 512 entries , this is not a  really requirement of the format,  just the way Creator creates its default palettes etc.

Code changed to look at the number of entries and use just those and fills in any missing entries with a default white colour"

From Fabio Mierlo,"I add a new option in the HDR Reader.

The RAW option store the RGBE values into a Image, to use
this option you need to decode the RGBE value in the frag-
ment shader. Follow the cube map glsl decoder:

vec4 textureCubeRGBE( uniform samplerCube sampler, vec3 coords )
{
   ivec4 rgbe = textureCube( sampler, coords ) * 255. + 0.5;
   float e = rgbe.a - ( 128 + 8 );
   return vec4( rgbe.rgb * exp2( e ), 1.0 );
}

This option is usefull for who have a outdate hardware like
FX cards and want to do cool things.

Finally this patch is need by a new HDR Rendering example
that I will put on the Wiki."

From Jeremy Bell,"My patch is a slight refactoring of the mac specific code in
Registry.cpp and FileUtils.cpp, specifically around the library and
resource file path initilialization methods. This patch cleans up a
lot of the mac specific code by moving repeated code into separate
local functions in FileUtils.cpp that are only compiled on mac builds.
It also adds one function to the API,
appendPlatformSpecificResourceFilePaths in FileUtils. This function
will mirror the already existing
appendPlatformSpecificLibraryFilePaths except for resource file paths.
Currently this function is empty except when built on the mac, in
which case it will add the application bundle's internal Resources
folder and the bundle's parent folder. Previously this code was
implemented as a separate mac specific #ifdef block in Registry.cpp
around the initDataFilePathList method. However, it now is implemented
in appendPlatformSpecificResourceFilePaths in FileUtils.cpp and the
initDataFilePathList method is now the same on all platforms. This
patch should behave the same as before on non-mac platforms.

This patch already includes the fix that Eric mentioned earlier. This
patch is based off of the 0.99 release code. I have tested this patch
using the following testing scheme:

Make a proper bundled application.
While Run from the Finder:
   Test that it finds plugins in its internal plugins path.
   Test that it finds resources in its internal resources path.
   Test that it finds resources in the bundle's parent directory
   Test that it finds plugins in the user's Application Support Directory
   Test that it finds plugins in the system's Application Support Directory
   Test that it finds plugins in the Network Application Support Directory
   Check the plugin and resource path lists after they have been
initialized to see if they are in the correct order

While Run from the command line (both from it's parent directory and
from inside the /Contents/MacOS directory) and repeat the above tests.
Check that it also finds plugins and resources within the paths
defined by various environment variables.

Now, Make an application that is NOT bundled/command line only
   Test that it does NOT try to look in an internal bundle
plugin/resource directory for plugins or resources.
   Test that it finds plugins/resources in the paths defined by the
environment variables.

From Colin McDonald,     "On fixing the pointer access I discovered that reading osga archives     containing ive files went into a cpu loop.  This turned out to be a     problem with proxy_streambuf on Solaris.  Public methods in the Solaris     streambuf standard library implementation rely on the gptr() being set,     which proxy_streambuf was not doing.  So I have modified     proxy_streambuf to set the input sequence pointers, and have also     aligned it more with the standard library streambuf implementation     where all input is through underflow(), not uflow() which merely calls     underflow() and advances the pointer."From Robert Osfield, change from using pointer cast and assignment to using
    a templated _write and _read method to avoid pointer aliasing to 2/4/8
    byte boundaries that some computer system may produce.  These changes
    where inspried by Colin McDonalds change to using memcpy, these
    changes weren't merged as memcpy is not as clear in naming as _read,
    _write and memcpy will incurr a function call just for copy a
    uint.



Fri, 24 Jun 2005 15:39:29 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Colin McDonald:    "Some makedefs fixes for Solaris:

    For multithreaded applications the -mt option must be specified on both
    the compile and link steps, to ensure correct behaviour.  According to
    the Sun compiler documentation it sets REENTRANT flags in the system
    header files, and links the -lthread library in the correct order.

    When compiling shared libraries the -KPIC option should be specified.
    Although Solaris will handle shared libraries without
    position-independent code there is a performance penalty.  The linker
    reference manual says: 'If a shared object is built from code that is
    not position-independent, the text segment will usually require a large
    number of relocations to be performed at runtime. Although the runtime
    linker is equipped to handle this, the system overhead this creates can
    cause serious performance degradation'."

This issue occurs first in 0.9.9, with 0.9.8 everything is fine. My fix involves calling dirtyBound() every time the on/off-values of the Switch are changed"

From David Guthrie, "The call NSLookupAndBindSymbol was changed to NSLookupSymbolInModule.  The former call would lookup the named symbol NOT in the current dynamic library, but in the entire running program while the call NSLookupSymbolInModule, takes the handle to the library the symbol should be found in.  This means the current code will fail if one loads multiple bundles at runtime and attempts to load the same named symbol from each one."

From Mathia Walker: bug fix to LOD ranges in TXP plugin to avoid cracks:"I took a closer look at the conditional code in
SeamFinder::seamReplacement().

Because _info.minRange is a double and lod->getMinRange(0) is a float,
the difference will be calculated with double precision. If
_info.minRange is cast as a float it is exactly the same value as
lod->getMinRange(0) and the difference is exactly zero.

So if you change


 if((fabs(_info.minRange-lod->getMinRange(0))<0.001)&&(fabs(_info.lod0Range-lod->getMaxRange(0))<0.001))

to


 if((fabs((float)_info.minRange-lod->getMinRange(0))<0.001)&&(fabs((float)_info.lod0Range-lod->getMaxRange(0))<0.001))

it works a lot better."

I fixed this by returning the length of the  vectors that form the basis.   I also added a function to orthonormalize the rotation component of the matrix. I seem to always run into situations where non uniform (or even uniform) scale complicate my calculations, and I thought other members of the community could use this function as well."

From Joson Daly, fix for forward/backward/swing animation handling both 15.8 and versions prior to 15.8, and..." Here's another fix for OpenFlight.  The symptom was that ATTR files were
not being read correctly, and the TexEnv on a texture that should have
been set to DECAL was instead defaulting to MODULATE.  The cause is that
the ATTR reader cannot tell by itself what version it's reading (the
version information isn't present in the ATTR files), and instead relies
on the ReaderWriter::Options passed in to get the OpenFlight version.

My change clones the current ReaderWriter::Options and prepends the
appropriate FLT_VER option before the ReaderWriterATTR object is
called.  I also made the parsing of the FLT_VER string and value more
robust in the ReaderWriterATTR itself.  I think I commented things OK,
but let me know if you need me to explain anything."

From Alberto Farre, nested files bug fix.

Mon, 4 Apr 2005 11:18:02 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
From Alberto Farre: "Here there are fixes for several flt loader problems.First one was an small bug when root database was an empty string we got a database path "/" instead of "./".
Second one is more complex. Flt loader works in two passes, first one reads flt database and second one builds osg scenegraph. Special care must be taken for properly tracking database path as nested files are entered. Because textures are loaded in second pass, mentioned care should be taken once again. I wrote time ago a piece of code and I placed it in both files fltFile.cpp and flt2osg.cpp. After a long period offline I have seen the portion of code at flt2osg was missing, I just made some tests and I could see it is still required.

Finally, I have seen that pool.cpp always try to make IMAGE cache instead of reading what Options says.

Aditonally, I recently wrote an osg change, now it has external references "a la flt" what is called osg::ProxyNode. As part of the change now flt loader builds external references as ProxyNodes. I made the same mistake like pool.cpp and always made ARCHIVE cache instead of see what Options says, it has also been fixed."

From Marco Jez, "Current version of the LWO plugin creates one Geode with a single Geometry for each Lighwave surface, in order to keep surface names (geometries can't have names). The attached fix adds a plugin option named "COMBINE_GEODES" that allows to place all geometries under a single Geode whenever possible, thus offering better chances of further optimization through osgUtil::Optimizer. The downside is that surface names are no longer stored in the scene graph when using this option."

From Tom Jolly.  a couple of small changes to osgParticle."The first is with
Particle.cpp.  I made a change so that when the lifetime is 0 (lasts
forever) the sizeRange, colorRange, and alphaRange are used to create
a random size, color, and alpha."

"The second change is with range and SectorPlacer.  The distribution of
particles across the sector was not uniform.  I added get_random_sqrtf()
function where it is used in SectorPlacer::Place().  This seems to make
the distribution uniform (at least when minimum radius is 0)."

From Corbin Holtz, "I have completed my mods to the OpenFlight loader (modified files are attached):    * Light point strings using the REPLICATE opcode should now be supported (>=15.6?)   * Directional lights should now work as in Performer using a viewing
frustrum defined by a direction vector, horizontal angular width, vertical
angular width, and roll angle about the direction vector.  The current
directional light implementation had some bad assumptions which caused
problems with direction vectors not on the XY plane.

   * IVE and OSG reader/writers were updated as appropriate"

From Paul Martz,"Changes to provide rudimentary support for OF 15.8 light point
animation palettes. This change also includes light point palette override
support for external references. This is the last of my code changes to
support OF 15.8 in the flt loader. Barring bugs, of course, knock on wood.

The gist of the animation palette code is to create ref_ptr'd
osgSim::BlinkSequence objects for each palette entry, and then pass them on
to osgSim::LightPoint for any OpenFlight light points that reference that
palette entry. This should be conservative of memory (not that I expect the
animation palette to be extremely large)."

Author : Robert Osfield
From Paul Marz : "Input.h, Input.cpp -- Here's where support for reading the continuation record goes. I added a new function to read a continued record body. I added code in the existing ReadRecord routine to peek ahead for a CONTINUATION_OP if the current record could possibly be continued.opcodes.h -- Besides adding the opcode for CONTINUATION_OP, I also added new
15.8 opcodes. I labeled opcodes as "ignored" if I could easily discern that
our loader wasn't doing anything with them. For historical reasons, I added
all obsolete opcodes, prefixed with "OBS_".

LocalVertexPoolRecord.h, LocalVertexPoolRecord.cpp -- This is one of three
types of records that can be continued with a CONTINUATION_OP record. I
removed all invalid assertions that assumed the record length would always
be less than 65535. I replaced the "vertex size" calculation with a more
efficient method based on caching the size from attribute bits, rather than
taking the length of the record and dividing it by numVerts (which would
have been incorrect if the record had been continued)."

It enhances the generation of texture coordinates on particles so that animated textures can be used, with the current frame of animation being computed from each particle's current age. Clients just have to call Particle::setTextureTile() and specify the number of horizontal and vertical tiles that make the animation up in the texture image."

From Paul Martz:"These two files fix the alignment bug in the flt plugin header
parsing, which I posted about on Saturday. They go in the flt plugin
directory.

The fix is to memcpy the data read from the flt file into individual fields
in our Header struct, then replace the raw (packed) data block with our
header struct. This avoids the alignment problem entirely, and all fields
now contain valid data."

Thu, 11 Dec 2003 23:26:22 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
Added support for controlling what optimization operations can be applied to specific nodes in the scene graph.  Typical use would be tagging a node so that it can't be optimized away in say a flatten static transform pass.  Added methods to Optimizer are:        inline void setPermissableOptionsForObject(const osg::Object* object, unsigned int options)
        {
            _permissableOptionsMap[object] = options;
        }

        inline unsigned int getPermissableOptionsForObject(const osg::Object* object) const
        {
            PermissableOptionsMap::const_iterator itr = _permissableOptionsMap.find(object);
            if (itr!=_permissableOptionsMap.end()) return itr->second;
            else return 0xffffffff;
        }

        inline bool isOperationPermissableForObject(const osg::Object* object,unsigned int option) const
        {
            return (option & getPermissableOptionsForObject(object))!=0;

Manipulators, Producer and SceneView. Note, SceneView still uses Matrix internally
so will depend on what is set as the default in include/osg/Matrix.

method that the viewer main loop uses for detecting the exit condition.

Merged changed to osgParticle from Marco Jez, the changes are (quoted from email from Marco)"Most relevant news:
1) particle systems now have the "freezeOnCull" property set to false by
default. Since it is an optimization, and using it may cause some unwanted
behaviors if not handled properly, it makes more sense to turn it off by
default.
2) new "LINE" shape mode which uses GL_LINES to draw line segments that
point to the direction of motion.
3) particles can now have a rotation angle and angular velocity.
4) new AngularAccelOperator applies angular acceleration to particles.
5) particle processors such as emitters and programs can have a "start",
"end" and "reset" time coordinate. For example, an emitter may be instructed
to start emitting particles only after a certain time, stop after another
amount of time and then start again.

Update (2) is from Gideon May.
Updates (3) to (5) are from Douglas A. Pouk."

Author : Don BURNS
Various changes to the BUILD system:     o Object files now go in subdirectories named $(OS)$(ARCH).Opt and
       $(OS)$(ARCH).Debug for OS's that support both architectures.
          eg.  Linux32.Opt and Linux32.Debug

     o Libraries links are now placed in lib/$(OS)$(ARCH)
          eg.  lib/Linux32/

     o Binaries are now placed in bin/$(OS)$(ARCH)
          eg. bin/Linux32

     o 'make install' and 'make instlinks' now place files/links in
       /usr/local/{include,lib,share/OpenSceneGraph} by default on
       most systems (Solaris still goes in /opt/OpenSceneGraph).
       Rather than having the somwehat confusing INST_SYS_PREFIX and
       INST_SHARE_PREFX, you can override these with just
            INST_LOCATION
       For example,
             make INST_LOCATION=/usr
       will place files at /usr/include, /usr/lib,
       /usr/share/OpenSceneGraph.

Author : Robert Osfield
Added Neil Salter's osgUtx library into the distribution, have put all the orignal seperate headers and source into include/osg/UnitTestFrameWork and src/osg/UnitTestFramework.cpp respectively.  I have done this to keep the include and source directories focused on the scene graph rather than the test framework.Have added a very simple unit test to Vec3.cpp, which are optionally
compiled in with the OSG_COMPILE_UNIT_TESTS define, which is only
currently defined in debug builds under unix.  It should be fine to
add it in under Windows project files as well.

Finally, a new demo app osgunittests runs the tests and reports success
or failure of the tests.

Several items of work related to adding a manual creation of occluders option to the osgoccluder demo.First the osgGA classes have been generalised a little to better support
new GUIEventHandler subclasses.

Second osgGLUT has a new option for registering a user defined event handler,
the allows the application to add externally extra options to the osgGLUT viewer.

Third, the osgoccluder demo now works in two modes. The original create
four occluder sides to wrap an loaded model, the second an interactive
mode which allows the users to add occluders to the model by pointing
to points and pressing 'a' to add a point, the 'e' to end the occluder
polygon, polygons must be convex, planer and be defined in an anitclockwise
order.  To start the osgoccluder in this mode one simple runs it with the
'-c' option.  Run osgoccluder with no parameter to get a list of options.

Fri, 12 Jul 2002 14:25:10 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
Have added a #define USE_DEPRECATED_API to include/osg/Export, and various osg header and source files to optional compile in deprecated parts of the OSG API.Have renamed osg::Transparency osg::BlendFunc to bring it in line with
the
rest of the OSG's StateAttribute classes which are named after their
OpenGL counterparts.  include/osg/Transparency still exists and is
simply
a typedef to BlendFunc and is enclosed in a #ifdef USE_DEPRECTATED_API
block.

The matrix methods in the osg::Transform class have been
moved/replicated in
a osg::MatrixTransform sublcass from osg::Transform.  The old matrix
functionality is still present in the osg::Transform class but is guard
by #ifdef USG_DEPRECATED_API blocks.  One should now think of
osg::Transform
as being a Transform Node base class.  MatrixTransform has all the
functionality of the original Transform class, so should be used
instead.

reducing the max texture size increases performance then you are limited
by texture memory!

This may break users code, but all it should require to fix the builds should be a change from osgUtil::CameraManipulator (etc) to osgGA::CameraManipulator and include <osgUtil/CameraManipulator (etc) to osgGA/CameraManipulator and the extra dependency of the link line.

Added DataVariance enum and set/get fields to osg::Object to help identify which objects have values that vary over the lifetime of the object (DYNAMIC) and ones that do not vary (STATIC).  Removed the equivalent code in osg::Transform, StateSet and StateAttribute, as these are now encompassed by the new DataVariance field.Removed MatrixMode enum from Matrix, and associated fields/parameters from
osg::Transfrom and osg::NodeVisitor, since MatrixMode was not providing
any useful functionality, but made the interface more complex (MatrixMode
was an experimental API)

Added ReferenceFrame field to osg::Transform which allows users to specify
transforms that are relative to their parents (the default, and previous behavior)
or absolute reference frame, which can be used for HUD's, camera relative
light sources etc etc.  Note, the view frustum culling for absolute Transform
are disabled, and all their parents up to the root are also automatically
have view frustum culling disabled.  However, once passed an absolute Transform
node culling will return to its default state of on, so you can still cull
underneath an absolute transform, its only the culling above which is disabled.

and fixed memory leaks highlighted by the new memory manager.

Added osg::MemoryManger which is currently based on Paul Nettle's memory manager published at flipcode.  I havn't adopted Paul's macro's for new/delete etc, but use osg prefixed versions instead to allow greater flexiblity in handling include ordering.Have fixed a couple of new/delete[] problems which existed as a result.

To use the MemoryManager to track memory usage simply add
-DOSG_USE_MEMEORY_TRACKING to the compile line.

Have yet to move the osg from using new to osgNew, will do this next.

Added osg:State:have_applied_mode(mode) and have_applied_attribute(type) to make it easier to specify which modes and attributes have been modified without the user requiring to know to what value, or to have an equivilant attribute to pass to the have_applied_attribute method.  The original have_applied(mode) and have_applied(attribute) methods have been renamed have_applied_mode(), have_applied_attribute() as this was required to prevent the mode and type values colliding during compile (it was causing a compile error when the method names were the same.)

entirely within RenderStageLighting, and changed the management of modelview
matrices so that RenderLeaf now stores the absolute modelview matrix, rather

a glLoadMatrix rather than a glPushMatrix/glMultMatrix/glPopMatrix.

Fixed a bug in the drive manipulator which was due to it using the local coords of the intersection point with the scene rather than the world coord value for that point.  The code now uses osgUtil::Hit::getWorldIntersectionPoint() method for getting the world coords.Added support for getWorldIntersectionPoint to Viewer.cpp.

Put and #ifdef around the setting of the default display list visitor so
it nolonger sets in under IRIX. This is a world around to the IR graphics
imbending lighting info into display lists, if the display lists are
created before state is set up it produces lighting artifacts such as
flickering.  Remove the the default display list init visitor removes
these problems, display lists are then built on the fly and drawables
a drawn for the first time.

Made the LineSegment destructor protected to force users to create segments on the stack thus ensure that they arn't created locally and have their memory deleted incorrectly.Also updated the IntersectVisitor so that it no used osg::ref_ptr<> internally
for storing all data. Have also move the IntersectState helper class to inside the
IntersectVisitor which simplifies the external interface to the class.

A couple of fixes to DeepCopy Cloner.

Mon, 28 Jan 2002 21:17:01 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
Added support for shallow and deep copy of nodes, drawables and state, via a copy constructor which takes an optional Cloner object, and the old osg::Object::clone() has changed so that it now requires a Cloner as paramter. This is passed on to the copy constructor to help control the shallow vs deep copying.  The old functionality of clone() which was clone of type has been renamed to cloneType().Updated all of the OSG to work with these new conventions, implemention all
the required copy constructors etc.  A couple of areas will do shallow
copies by design, a couple of other still need to be updated to do either
shallow or deep.

Neither of the shallow or deep copy operations have been tested yet, only
the old functionality of the OSG has been checked so far, such running the
viewer on various demo datasets.

Also fixed a problem in osg::Optimize::RemoveRendundentNodesVisitor which
was not checking that Group didn't have have any attached StateSet's, Callbacks
or UserData.  These checks have now been added, which fixes a bug which was
revealled by the new osgscribe demo, this related to removal of group acting
as state decorator.

new osg::Transform::getLocalToWorldMatrix() which has the same functionality
as the old getMatrix() but is now supports subclasses of osg::Transform
transparently.

Have added osg::PositionAttitudeTransform as subclass of osg::Transform
which manages the transform as position and attitude via a Vec3 and Quat
respectively.

Fixed problem with Optimzer::removeRedundentNodesVisitor which was removing the correct redundent groups but for groups which had a single child it was was not using replaceChild to rettach the child to its parents. It was using parent->removeChild(group)...parent->addChild(child); which was allow the child to be attached in a different place than the original group, this broke LOD code. Have used removeChild instead which solves the LOD problem.

Changed the ordering of applying OpenGL modes and attributes back to the original modes first then attributes since the it was cause a display bug on some datesets.  It seems that the modes needs enabling before glMaterial's take affect, at least on the NVidia drivers under Windows and Linux. The OpenGL reference guide doesn't mention any dependancy so I'm not sure what the official line is.  Some other OpenGl attribute and modes need to be applied in that order according to the blue book, however, drivers, at least the NVidia drivers seem require the opposite.  This may raise the spectra of before and after mode applies, but this will require extra support in osg::State and osg::StateAttribute, and would have to be handled on a per attribute basis, and possibly different of each platform.  Yuck.

Fixed FlattenStaticTransformVisitor bug which related to incorrect handling of objects which were transformed by multiple matrices at one time - this cannot be handled in the flattening process (since we only have one piece of geometry to transform).

Fixed the osg::Light so that it requires the user to explicitly define which OpenGL light is being operated on, and also now relies upong the standard osg::State handling of OpenGL modes to switch on the appropriate lights.The previous static counter mechansim for the light number was causing a
redundent light to be created when the osg plugin created the first osg::Light
to use a prototype for other osg::Light's to be cloned from in the
.osg plugin execution.

The static count mechanism also prevent the lights modes being controlled
independantly from the setting of the light paramters themselves.  This
meant that a light once created was global, and couldn't be turned off
locally via the OSG's support for OpenGL mode enabling/disabling.  This
has been overcome with the new implementation, the user has complete
flexiblity of when and where to use the different lights at their
disposal.

From John Davis, a little addition to the Windows version of the osg::Timer constructor such that a static variable is used to force the constructor to check the number of clock cycles per second once, this means that multiple timers can now be created with incurring a the 1 second delay used for timming the clock speed every time the constructor is called.

Added osgText::Paragraph which is a subclass from Geode which composes a list of text drawables as a paragraph block, handles breaking of text into individual lines automatically.Changed the osg::Node::setUserData so that the data type has to be an
osg::Referenced, and removes the dependancy on osg::MemoryAdapter.  I have
done this since it simplifies the OSG side of the interface and makes it
less like that the user might abuse the memory managment of the data. It
does however mean that user data will have by subclassed from Referenced,
and therefor may require users to have their own adapter to do this.
However, this little nuasance is worth the extra cleaness and robustness
afforded by going the osg::Referenced route.

Author : Robert Osfield
Added support for an osgUtil::SceneView::init() traversal which is called once per scene view.  The user can attach a NodeVisitor to do init for them, or leave it to the default which is to use the osgUtil::DisplayListVisitor which compiles all display lists and texture objects.  The init traversal is called automatically by the first call to either app() or cull(), so should not be called by user code during initialization. This ensures that a valid graphics context has been established before OpenGL is initialized.osgUtil::DisplayListVisitor has also been updated to use a bit mask for options, and the addition of
compilation of texture objects (via StateAttribute::compile) has also been
added.

Author : Robert Osfield
Added support for specifying whether view frustum and small feature culling should be applied to a node or its child with the new osg::Node::setCullingActive() flag.  A mechanism has been implemented so that if child has its culling disabled then their parents, all the way up to the root are also have their culling implicitly disabled.The osg::CullVisitor has updated to take account of
both the explicit control via setCullingActive and the implicit culling
disabling through children being disabled.

This feature is useful for nodes which don't have a bounding volume to cull
against, earth sky implementations and light sources.

The default osg::Node::_cullingActive is true, i.e. culling is enabled by
default.

Made the new global state attribute instances in osg::State use osg:ref_ptr to automatically handle the memory deletion.

Mon, 15 Oct 2001 14:07:54 +0000
Author : Robert Osfield
Added support for automatic creation of global StateAttributes to osg::State, these global attributes are created by cloning any attributes which are applied during rendering, the clone in a shallow copy, which will set up default valus for that attribute.  This should prevent attribute bleed from one stateset to the next when the global StateSet doesn't contain an attribute used within the scene graph.

Added osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options class to the ReaderWriter base class, support for settings options in osgDB::Registry, and added the paramter to all of the reaader/writer plugins.  The Options structure by default has an string attached for packing basic options, however, it also can be subclassed to encapsulate any users defined option data. In the later case both the client code *and* the plugin need to be aware of subclass, the plugin will need to use dynamic_cast<> to assertain its type.

Quaternions were assigning inverted values during conversion to matricies. This is probably due to an error on the gamasutra web page demonstrating this. It caused left-handed rotations rather than right handed rotations.  Should be fixed now.

Added setAttributeAndModes(new Depth,StateAttribute::ON); to the StateSet::setGlobalDefault() so that the correct default for the glDepthFunc etc are set up for scene graphs, and allows override of these value which risk of inheriting state on to the rest of the scene graph.This has allowed the hangglide demo to be simplified since it now doesn't need to set the global Depth instance itself.

  1) new implementation of the osg::Matrix class.  Note details below.   2) cleaned up osg::Timer, still in progress.  My intent has been to      pave the way for support for other OS's.   3) new osg::FrameStamp class which has a frame number, reference      time for each frame to be app, culled and drawn.  The FrameStamp      also can be passed to other machines (i.e. cluster) and the      FrameStamp can be used with the slaves own app,cull and draw.      I've also added the beginings of a calander time data to the      FrameStamp to allow time or day and year to be used in setting      up position of sun/moon etc. etc.   4) The osg::State now has contains a pointer to the last applied      osg::Camera and the current osg::FrameStamp, so that drawables      can use both pieces of information for creating effects such      CLOD, earth/sky etc.  The osg::NodeVisitor also now allows you      to attach a FrameStamp to support syncronization of actions on      the scene graph.

  o Added osgUtil::StateOptimizeVisitor which traversing the scene     graph and builds up a map of all StateAttributes and StateSets     and then removes the duplicates. This promotes state sharing     throughout the scene graph which inturn can significantly improve     performance thanks to reduced state changing. Particularily     effective on datasets where a great deal of duplicated state exists.   o Added pure virtual compare(const osg::StateAttribute&)     method to osg::StateAttribute, and implemented it in all the     subclasses from StateAttribute. Added <,== & != operator     on StateAttribute and Matrix to support new StateOptimizeVisitor.   o Added META_Object, META_Node and META_StateAttribute macros to     Object, Node and StateAttribute respectively which define the     standard pure virtual methods such as clone, className     & isSameKindAs.  Changed all the appropriate header files to     use these macro's rather define them in each header, these cleans     up the headers considerably.   o Corrected the implementation of osg::Light::getType so it correctly     uses a unique type for each of the OpenGL lights (GL_LIGHT0..     GL_LIGHT7 relates to osg::StateAttriburte::LIGHT_0..LIGHT_7.   o Changed the definition of osg::StateStateAttribute::Type to     is now a unsigned int rather than an enum, and have changed the     name of the previous Type enum list to be Types.  This makes it     more consistent with the difination of values found in StateAttribute     and also easier to extend with having to cast to an enum.   o From Pail Fredrikson, updated Maitrx.new implemention which uses     the same matrix orientation as the original Matrix implemention.

  o Updated Metrowerks files for MacOS.  They aren't 100% there yet,     but getting there.  o First cut of osgcluster demo.  Very simple beginings.  Alas
    I only one PC here so I can't test it in its current guise.

  o New support for NodeCallbacks, via AppCallback attached to
    osg::Node's, and a default osgUtil::AppVisitor which calls them on
    each frame.

  o Support for traversal masks in osg::NodeVisitor, osg::Node
    which allows nodes to be switched on or off via a bit mask.

  o Suppport for traversal number (frame number) and reference time
    into osg::NodeVisitor to handle syncronization of app and cull
    traversals.  This also assist clustering as traversal number
    master to slaves.
