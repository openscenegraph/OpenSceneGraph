For compiliation, installation and platform specific information
read "Getting Started" at http://www.openscenegraph.org, under 
"Documentation".

Quick hints for Unix (including Mac OSX and Cygwin):

  gmake   - to make the disitribtion.

  gmake install  - to intall the disitrubion (defaults to /usr/local/)

  gmake help - for list of make instructions.

Note, the OpenSceneGraph's Make system requires the use of GNU gmake, on
OSX, Linux and FreeBSD this is the default make, but on Solaris and IRIX 
you may need to download & install it.
