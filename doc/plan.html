<h2>
<u>Plans for future developments</u></h2>
Now we have reached the beta phase (0.9.x) of OpenScenegGraph project,
and are now working towards the full 1.0 release, with a likely 
release date in fall 2002.

<h3>
Fturue work include:</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Multi-pass fallback for when multi-texturing is not supported.</li>

<li>
Clean up the API for managing multi-stage and multi-pass rendering within
the scene graph.</li>

<li>
Open Producer - cross platform library for transparently managing mulitpipe and
cluster graphics systems. Similar in concept to OpenGL multipipe SDK, except
cross platform and with support of graphics clusters.</li>

<li>
osgSim - cross platform library for the visual simulation market with support for light points,
small target anti-aliasing, geometry correction and clip mapping.</li>

<li>
Replace osgProducer with Open Producer for the demos.  Open Producer is a much cleaner and more scalable
windowing API. Move osgProducer out of the distribution and into the bazaar.</li>

<li>
Introduce a new library osgEnv/osgShapes, which adds support for creating
shapes and environmental effects such as stars, planets, cloud layers and
ground planes.</li>

<li>
Integrate unit tests for all classes, using the osgUtx Unit Test Framework.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Books, tutorials and demonstrations</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Don Burns and Robert Osfield to write the OpenSceneGraph book!</li>

<li>
Development of tutorials to published as part of the distribution and on
the bazaar</li>

<li>
Development of technology demonstrations for shows, presentations and training.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
Professional services</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Set up a support contract and support systems for confidential, email,
phone and onsite support.</li>

<li>
Set up the Open Scene Graph Professional License (OSGPL) which is conventional
proprietary license that allows companies to distribute projects that do
not comply with the terms of the LGPL, such as turn key systems.</li>

<li>
Develop training courses.</li>
</ul>
