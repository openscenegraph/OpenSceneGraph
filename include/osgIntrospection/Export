/**

\namespace osgIntrospection

The osgIntrospection library provides the an introspection/reflection framework for non intrusive
run-time querying and calling of class properties and methods.

osgIntrospection is ideal for providing non native language binding to the OpenSceneGraph, convenient means
for editing properties in a generic way, such as required in scene graph editors,
and also facilitates the automatic serealization of objects.

osgIntrospection can be used to provide introspection support to 3rd Party libraries without the need to
modify them to add this support, the wrappers providing the actual binding can be
automatically generated by parsing header files via gen_wrapper utility.  All the
core OpenSceneGraph libraries have pre built wrappers available for you use.
