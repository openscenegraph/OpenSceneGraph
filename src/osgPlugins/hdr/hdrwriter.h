/*
 The following code was based on code from the following location:
    http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/formats/rgbe/

 It includes the following information :

    "This file contains code to read and write four byte rgbe file format
    developed by Greg Ward.  It handles the conversions between rgbe and
    pixels consisting of floats.  The data is assumed to be an array of floats.
    By default there are three floats per pixel in the order red, green, blue.
    (RGBE_DATA_??? values control this.)  Only the minimal header reading and
    writing is implemented.  Each routine does error checking and will return
    a status value as defined below.  This code is intended as a skeleton so
    feel free to modify it to suit your needs.

    (Place notice here if you modified the code.)
