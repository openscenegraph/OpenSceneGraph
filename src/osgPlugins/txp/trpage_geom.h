/* The material definition for TerraPage encompasses those things that have to
   do with visual display that can be indexed and disassociated from the
   polygons themselves.  This covers things like color, texture, alpha
   and a few more obscure ones.
   Materials are indexed centrally in a trpgMatTable.

   This material definition borrows heavily from the OpenGL specification.
   Please refer to that for a good definition of all the fields.

   If you're doing a TerraPage reader you'll need to deal with these in two places.
   First, is when you read the archive header and get a trpgMatTable back.  You'll
   want to translate them into your own internal representation and keep track of
   the mapping.  Later, when parsing trpgGeometry nodes, you'll run into them
   again.  This time they will be material indices into a trpgMatTable.  At that
   point you'll want to map these indices into your own material definition table.

   If you're doing a TerraPage writer you'll need to create one of these for every
   unique material-like object you have.  Since trpgMaterial objects are indexed
   centrally in a TerraPage archive, you should take advantage of that and use
   as few as possible.  After defining one, you'll want to add it to a trpgMatTable
   and keep track of the material index that returns.  This will be the mapping from
   your own internal material table (or whatever you've got) into the archive's
   material table.  A trpgMaterial sets up defaults that work pretty well, so just
   fill in what you need to use.

/* The Range Table is new to 2.0.  The goal is to provide information about
   certain classes of features within a TerraPage database.  It's intended
   to solve the following problem.

   Let's say that you have an Image Generator that must draw a given TerraPage
   database at 60Hz.  However, it's only hitting 30Hz reliably.  Often, some
   feature set (e.g. bushes) must be sacrified in order to reach the target frame rate.
   Determining which features can be throttled back can often be very difficult.
   Scaling all of the LODs will often work, but it's not very elegant.  It's
   not selective (you may lose important features as well as unimportant ones)
   and it doesn't easily let turn whole feature sets off.

   If you do want to selectively turn features on and off or throttle them
   back, you can do so based on node names within the LODs.  This can work, however
   you've got the additional overhead of traversing the tree looking for LODs
   and trying to figure out what the names mean.  The range table is intended
   to make this task easier.

   Each trpgLod can (but isn't required to) have an index into the Range Table.
   That index will point to a trpgRange that contains global information
   about that class of LODs.  This includes the in/out information already contained
   within the LOD as well as global info.  The global information includes a category
   and sub-category as well as an integer priority.  The category data is there to
   allow run-time systems to tell users what they're dropping (or allow them to pick).
   The priority is there to tell systems what to get rid of first (according to the
   user who build the TerraPage archive).

   Priorities are relative to each other within the Range Table.  There can be
   duplicates and there may be holes in the numbering.

/* All materials are centrally indexed in TerraPage.  There is one material
   table per archive.  All trpgGeometry nodes point to that material table (with indices)
   for their trpgMaterial definitions.

   The material table has one wrinkle.  It is divided up into sub-tables or channels.
   Each sub-table has the same number of materials, so there will be NxM trpgMaterial
   structures in a trpgMatTable.  The sub-tables are intended for use in simple sensor
   simulations.  For example, the base table (0) is the purely visual, out the window
   representation.  The next table (1) might the Infra-Red version.  It's up to the run-time
   system to switch between these two.  TerraPage simply provides the means for keeping
   track of it.

   If you're doing a TerraPage reader you'll get a trpgMatTable from the trpgr_Archive.
   This is your central index for materials.  If you can handle the multiple channels/sub-tables
   then you can access those as you need.  If you can't, just use 0 for the sub-table index where appropriate.

   If you're doing a TerraPage writer you'll need to build up a trpgMatTable to pass to
   trpgwArchive.  If you're only doing a single sub-table (i.e. visible materials only)
   just use AddMaterial and add them as you go.  The trpgMaterial object you build up
   for a given material are copied when you call the add function.  So you can have a single

   Texture objects are really just references to these on-disk textures.  As such,
   they're pretty simple.  They just consist of a filename.  These trpgTexture
   objects will be indexed in a trpgTexTable.  The indices you get from trpgMaterial
   objects point to trpgTexture objects through that table.  trpgMaterial objects
   should be the only things that have texture indices.

   If you're doing a TerraPage reader textures are pretty simple to read in.  There
   are two ways to do it.  First, if you're not doing texture paging, simply read
   them all in, using the trpgTexTable to figure out where they all are.  If you
   are doing texture paging (highly recommended) then you'll need to call GetNumTile
   to figure out how many tiles a texture is used in.  If it's 1, then this is probably
   a geospecific textures and ought to be paged.  If it's more than 1, then it's a
   geotypical texture (i.e. a tree or road) and should be loaded in at the beginning.

   If you're doing a TerraPage writer you'll need to be creating trpgTexture objects
   as you go and adding them to your central trpgTexTable.  If you want to support
   texture paging set the numTile count to 1 for the geospecific textures and more
   than 1 for everything else.  There are utility functions for keeping track of all
   of this.  It's best to use those.

/* Models are basically just references in TerraPage.  This class just points
   to a model from somewhere else.  There are two places it can point.  (1) It
   can point externally to a model in some arbitrary format (OpenFlight(tm) is
   a popular one).  (2) It can also point to a model within the TerraPage archive.
   The first case is much like trpgTexture objects are treated.  That is, the actual
   thing itself is on disk somewhere corresponding to a file name.  The second case is
   more like tile terrain geometry.  In that case there is scene node type data (LODs,
   groups, geometry, etc...) associated with it.

   trpgModel objects live within a trpgModelTable.  They are indexed there and referred
   to by trpgModelRef objects.  Those model references are the only things that explicitly
   use trpgModel objects.

   If you're doing a TerraPage reader you'll need to take into account whether the
   model is external or internal.  If it's external you'll need to read the given file
   and convert it to your own representation.  If it's internal you've probably already
   got the code for dealing with terrain tiles, which is essentially the same thing.
   Models can be paged, if you're so inclined.  They have tile reference counts just
   like trpgTexture objects.  If numTile == 1 then page it, if > 1 then don't.

   If you're doing a TerraPage writer you'll want to build up a trpgModelTable of these
   as you encounter them.  If your models are external in some other format then setting
   up a trpgModel is pretty easy.  If you want to do internal models, the support is not

/* The tile header is one of the more interesting parts of TerraPage.  Basically,
   it's a list of all the materials, local material  and models used in a tile.
   Tile headers are stuck at the beginning of terrain tiles to give you this
   information.  They can be read separately, in theory, although no one is doing
   that at present.

   If you're doing a TerraPage reader you will encounter one of these first thing
   when you parse a terrain tile.  These are here to aid texture and model paging.
   Texture paging is the most common and there are now two ways of doing it.  The
   simpler one (supported in version 1.0) is as follows.  Textures are indexed at
   the beginning of a TerraPage archive (in a trpgTexTable) and when listed in the
   trpgTileHeader for a tile must be loaded in for use.  You can tell the pageable
   textures from the non-pageable ones by looking at the tile reference count in
   the trpgTexture object.

   The second way of doing texture paging (in version 2.0) is more complex, but
   much more powerful.  One of the big problems we encountered with v1.0 was the
   enormous proliferation of texture files.  In addition, much information was
   duplicated between the different terrain resolutions.  Lastly, we (TERREX) have
   had a lot of success with wavelet compressed image pyramids for solving quite a
   few interesting problems.  This second approach to texture paging makes use of
   what we've learned from all of this.  The idea is that instead of having lots of
   little textures, we have a small number of very large images which can support
   extraction at any resolution.  In this way we re-use information between terrain
   levels of detail and we cut down on our disk usage, both in terms of number of
   files as well as data size.

   To implement this scheme we added the trpgLocalMaterial object.  trpgTexture
   objects tell you if they are global images (e.g. parts are pageable).  If they
   are, then they can be used in a trpgLocalMaterial.  These objects define the
   sub-image (extents and a resolution) for a texture/material that can be used
   within this tile (and only within this tile).  The trpgLocalMaterial objects
   reside within the trpgTileHeader and should be filled out (e.g. the sub-images
   paged) as soon as the trpgTileHeader is parsed because you'll be needing them
   in trpgGeometry nodes to follow.

   If you want to page models, you can do so by looking at the list of model IDs
   used in a tile.

   If you're doing a TerraPage writer you will need to construct one of these for
   each tile that you build (remember that tiles are per-terrain LOD).  You'll want
   to call AddMaterial for every material that you use in a tile and AddModel
   for every model.  You can call these methods multiple times and it will keep track
   of whether you've already added a model or material.  The tile header will then
   be passed to trpgwArchive along with the tile geometry and written to disk.

    We use data arrays to store lists of vertices, colors, texture coordinates, and

    In general, you'll want to do a GetPrimType() to figure out what primitive
    type (PrimType) a given node is holding.  It will typically be TriStrips,
    TriFans, or Triangles, but all the other types are valid as well.
    The next step is to get the vertices via a GetVertices() call and then get
    the normals and texture coordinates (via GetNormals() and GetTexCoordSet() calls).
    To get the material information call GetNumMaterial() (if you can support more
    than one texture per polygon) and then GetMaterial() for each material.  If you
    only support one material/texture per polygon then just do one GetMaterial() all.
    There's always guaranteed to be at least one material.

/* This is a standard Group that you might see in any reasonable
   scene graph.  It holds a number of children.  TerraPage isn't
   actually a scene graph, it just represents one.  That means that there
   are no pointers to children here.  Instead you'll encounter this group
   while reading a terrain tile or model.  That tells you to create a group
   (or whatever you call it) in your own system and get read to dump child
   trees into it.  A push will follow this object, then the children (however
   deep they may be) then a pop.

   All groups have IDs.  These IDs are unique among groups and group-like things
   (i.e. LODs) and are used to hook trpgAttach geometry into a scene graph hierarchy
   as you page in higher terrain levels of detail.

   If you're doing a TerraPage reader, the group tells you to put together
   your generic container in a scene graph and get read for the push/children/pop.
   The NumChild field should tell you how many children will follow, but a writer
   can easily forget to put it, so be wary.  You'll also want to look at the group
   ID and build a mapping from that ID (look at the max group ID in trpgHeader) to
   your own group structure.  A trpgAttach is allowed to page itself into any group.

   If you're doing a TerraPage writer you'll create one of these, fill out the
   numChild hint, the group ID and then write it.  You'll then write a Push, then
   the children hierarchies (which can be anything) followed by a Pop.  You'll want
   to keep track of the group ID you assigned in case one of the children is a
   pageable chunk of terrain hierarchy.

/* Structurally, an attach is just like a trpgGroup.  It does everything a group
   does, plus a little bit more.  The attach node is how TerraPage does terrain
   database paging across LODs.

   In TerraPage we don't enfoced a terrain LOD structure.  Let's say you built
   your database as a quad-tree.  That is, there is one root tile per block,
   4 children, each of which has 4 of its own children etc...  That would imply
   a certain structure (4 children per tile until you reach the bottom).  That would
   also lock you into a database scheme (quad-tree).  However, let's assume that
   someone else wanted to do replacement LOD for their terrain.  That scheme works
   by having one child per tile.  If you want to support both of these then you're
   asking the reader to do a lot of thinking and you can pretty much assume that the
   one you don't test won't work.  We decided to avoid all that by coming up with a
   generic scene graph paging scheme.  It's a little more painfull, but once you deal
   with it you get whatever weird scheme the writer is using for free without having to
   think about it.

   Here's how it works.  Each trpgGroup and group-like structure (trpgLod for example)
   has a unique group ID.  You can have one trpgAttach at the start of a given terrain
   tile.  That trpgAttach can point to any group within the scene graph (with a group ID).
   Level of detail for the terrain is controlled by trpgLod nodes as if everything was
   loaded in all the time.  That is, you'll see the same thing no matter whether every node
   is loaded into memory or just the nearby ones.  The theoretical scene graph structure
   is the same no matter what.  It's the ranges in your trpgHeader that tell you when
   things ought to be loaded in, but the actual display logic is contained within the trpgLod
   objects.  It sounds complicated and it is... for the writer.  But for the reader it's
   really simple.

   If you're doing a TerraPage reader all you'll need to do is keep a mapping from group
   ID's to your own internal scene graph node representation.  Then when a trpgAttach shows
   up you can turn it into your own group-like thing and stuff it and its children into
   the scene graph.  When it wanders out of range (the trpgHeader tells you that for a given
   terrain LOD) you simply delete it.  If you out-run your paging you've got two options:
   (1) Display holes.  That's what will happen when the LOD above a given tile trpgAttach
   turns on without the children in memory; or (2) Don't switch LODs that don't have all
   their children loaded in yet.  Be aware that a trpgAttach inherits from trpgGroup and
   so can have trpgAttach children.  So don't absorb the trpgAttach even though it's extra
   hierarchy.  Also, don't make any assumptions that there is really terrain in a given
   tile.  The writer may have chosen to page buildings or trees.  You never know and there's
   no reason to assume.

   If you're doing a TerraPage writer this is slightly more complex than writing a normal
   format, depending on the structure of your internal scene graph.  If you don't want
   to write more than one pageable terrain LOD you can just ignore trpgAttach nodes.  This
   doesn't mean you can only have one terrain LOD, it only means they won't be pageable.
   If you do want to fully support it, what you'll need to
   do is give all your groups (or whatever will become groups) unique IDs, keeping in mind
   to update the trpgHeader max group ID as you go.  Start at the lowest terrain lod.  This
   one doesn't need to have a trpgAttach node since it's at the top.  Traverse toward
   the higher lods.  When you hit one, spit out a trpgAttach, giving it the group ID of
   the trpgGroup directly above it.  Then treat the node you just created as a trpgGroup
   (i.e. do its children as normal).  You will also need to keep the trpgTileHeader for
   each tile around.  It's best to index these by (x,y,lod) index.  You'll need to build
   that tile header up *just for this tile geometry*.  That means you have to stop adding
   material/model references when you start defining the next tile.  Depending on how you
   write out your scene graph it may make sense to keep a stack of trpgTileHeader and
   trpgMemWriteBuffer objects around indexed by tile (x,y,lod).

/* TerraPage level of detail nodes are pretty simple.  Even though they don't inherit from trpgGroup,
   they have many of the same calls and act, structurally at least, in much the same way.  These
   act as a switch.  When the user's eye point is within a distance then the children of this
   node should be turned on for display.  Otherwise, the children will be invisible.

   A simple on/off test for a TerraPage lod might look like this:
   If ( in < dist < out || out < dist < in) then
   Turn children on
   else
   Turn children off.

   There is also a transition width can be used to fade LODs in and out around
   the transition zones.  Keep in mind that these LODs are binary.  Children
   are either on or off (in the process of being turned off).  The position of
   a child doesn't have any special meaning with respect to range.

   If you're doing a TerraPage reader you'll need to turn this into your own LOD
   structure.  Keep in mind that trpgAttach nodes can and do attach to trpgLod
   nodes.  If you have a general purpose LOD in your scene graph this should be
   pretty easy.  However, you must have implemented the concept of LOD center and
   you definitely should *not* recalculate the LOD center yourself based on the
   center of child geometry.  They may not be the same.  In fact, many terrain
   LOD schemes depend on them not being the same.

   If you're doing a TerraPage writer you'll need to use these both for geometry
   that you want to disappear at certain distances (e.g. trees, houses, etc..), but
   also terrain.  Any terrain LOD scheme you implement must use these to drop out
   polygons in the distance.  You'll need to set the center and in/out/width info.
   Otherwise it's like a group.

   In TerraPage 2.0 we added the Range Index field.  This field is here to help
   run-time systems gracefully degrade visual fidelity.  The trpgLod node still acts
   like a normal LOD and you can safely ignore the range index field.  If, however,
   you want to use it, please read the documention on the trpgRangeTable for further
